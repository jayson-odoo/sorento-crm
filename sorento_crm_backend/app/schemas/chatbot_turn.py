"""Response shapes for the turn trace admin API (AC-257).

**Every field the screen reads is declared here.** `response_model` silently DROPS an
undeclared field, and the two that would go first - `trace` and `response` - are the whole
point of the screen: a trace list that arrives empty looks like "the engine recorded
nothing", not like "the schema forgot to say the column exists".

`trace` records and `response` stay loosely typed on purpose. Their shape is the ENGINE's
(`app/services/chatbot/trace.py`, `contracts.py`), the turn rows already in the table were
written by earlier versions of it, and a strict model here would drop a field the day the
engine adds one - the exact failure this file exists to prevent, arriving through the back
door.
