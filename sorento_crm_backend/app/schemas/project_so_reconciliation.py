"""Fulfilment Planning and reconciliation wire shapes (Stage 1B).

Contract: `documentation/plans/scm/STAGE1B-scm-front-planning-reconciliation.md` section 3,
which the frontend was built against in Phase 1. Field names and optionality here match
`app/(protected)/project-sales/_shared/types/fulfilmentPlanning.types.ts` exactly.

Two things are load bearing:

* **Quantities are ``Decimal``**, which pydantic renders as a JSON string. A float round
  trip loses the tail of a quantity the customer signed for.
* **An exception's ``message`` carries the reason alone.** The screen prints the subject
  from ``line_no`` and ``item_code`` ("Line 2, SRT501-CP"), so a message that repeats the
  subject renders the same fact twice.

Nothing here is a per-line workflow state: the whole SO has exactly one pre-confirmation
state (AC-A03), so no line ever reads confirmed, partially confirmed or purchasing-ready.
