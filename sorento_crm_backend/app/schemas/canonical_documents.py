"""Canonical shapes for the DOCUMENTS the ESB pushes: sales and purchase orders.

The masters' rules all hold here (`canonical_masters`): canonical rather than
AutoCount, `extra="forbid"`, related records addressed by reference rather than
by a Sorento id. Three things are different, and each is a property of a
document rather than of a master:

**A document owns its lines.** They arrive nested, not as a second entity, so
one push is one atomic statement about the whole order. Splitting them would let
a header land without its lines - an order for nothing, which the netting reads
as fully covered demand.

**Its line key is the line's own.** `source_ref` on a line is AutoCount's
`DtlKey`, not a position: a line deleted upstream must not silently renumber the
ones after it onto each other's allocations. Two lines carrying the same key in
one record is therefore a validation failure rather than a last-one-wins, since
picking one would drop a quantity somebody ordered.

**Its status is a vocabulary.** Five canonical words - `open`, `partial`,
`fulfilled`, `closed`, `cancelled` - map onto two different Sorento vocabularies
(sales orders and purchase orders do not share theirs). The mapping lives in
`document_ingest_service`; what is fixed here is that `status` is required. A
document with no state is not a document anyone can plan against.

Money and quantity are `Decimal`, never float: these figures are summed into
what a customer is charged.
