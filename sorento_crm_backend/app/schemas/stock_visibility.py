"""Admin API shapes for the stock visibility policy.

One body for every tier (`{effective, override}`), so the same card serves the
contact page, the access-type admin and the settings default without three
response shapes to keep in step. The full contract, request and response, is
documented at the top of `sorento_crm_frontend/services/stockVisibilityService.ts`.
