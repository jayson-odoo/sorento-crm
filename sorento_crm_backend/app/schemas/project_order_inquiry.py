"""Order inquiry schemas (P10, AC-I1 to AC-I7).

A row is one instruction to purchasing. It carries the sales order NUMBER rather than its
id, the item CODE rather than the product id, and the warehouse CODE rather than the
warehouse id, so nothing on this screen is a UUID a person has to resolve for themselves.

``remark`` is the same field the client's own spreadsheet calls REMARK: the verb in their
spelling, or the SPO reference itself for a row already on the water. It ships beside the
raw ``verb`` so the screen can colour by verb while printing what purchasing reads.
