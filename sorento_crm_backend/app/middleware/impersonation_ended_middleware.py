"""Say so when a view-as header was ignored (SESSION-NEVER-STUCK).

``dependencies._maybe_apply_impersonation`` serves the admin's own data when it cannot
honour ``X-Impersonate-User-Id`` (view-as stopped elsewhere, admin role removed, target
deactivated). Without a signal the client kept its "viewing as X" banner over that data.
The dependency marks ``request.state.impersonation_ended``; this stamps
``X-Impersonation-Ended: 1`` on whatever response follows, error statuses included,
which a dependency's own ``Response`` parameter could not do.
