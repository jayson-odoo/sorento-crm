"""The chatbot turn as an RQ job (AC-703).

`CHATBOT_TURN_ON_WORKER` moves the turn off the API thread and onto the `chat` queue; the
request still waits for it and still answers n8n with the finished turn. Nothing about the
turn changes here - this module is the seam that lets the work run in a different process,
which is why it is twenty lines and holds no logic of its own.

**One of the three files allowed to import `app.services.chatbot`**
(`tests/chatbot/test_import_boundary.py`). It is a doorway, not a caller with opinions.

`offload=False` on the call below is load-bearing: without it the worker would read the
same flag the API read, decide to offload, and enqueue the turn to the queue it is
currently draining - forever, at whatever rate redis can accept.
