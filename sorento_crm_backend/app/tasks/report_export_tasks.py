"""Background task for report workbook exports (My Downloads).

Same shape as the other exports in app/tasks/export_tasks.py: the API creates a
UserDownload row in 'pending' and enqueues this; the task renders, uploads through the
storage router and flips the row to 'ready' or 'failed'. Never raises into RQ's failed
registry - a row stuck in 'processing' tells the user nothing.

The export path runs the engine UNCAPPED (``run_workbook`` never caps): the caps exist to
keep a runaway run off the request path, and this is not the request path. What comes back
is the SUMMARY plus one detail table per month of the period, which is the shape the client
keeps by hand.

RQ has no reload: restart the worker after editing this file.
