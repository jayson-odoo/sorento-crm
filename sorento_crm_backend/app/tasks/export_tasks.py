    when that update touches a row. Between them the outcome is exactly one of {the turn
    returned the file, the worker pushed it} (AC-46) - an unclaimed row was delivered
    inside the turn, and pushing it would send the same workbook twice. `delivered_at IS
    NULL` in the same predicate is what makes a RETRIED RQ job harmless.

    A refusal from Respond is SWALLOWED rather than raised: raising would poison the job

    logging (`_PRE_LOG_REFUSAL_CODES`) - a 502 `respond_send_failed` is already logged by
    the sender, and writing a second row would double-count one send (reviewer item 5).

    `delivered_at` is deliberately LEFT SET. It means "this worker has taken its one shot",
