class ProductSpecVerification(Base):
    """Who vouched for a code's specs, and who or what took that back.

    Keyed on `product_code` for the same reason derivation is: the model exists once
    per company and a person confirming its specs is confirming the model, not one
    company's copy of it. Deliberately NOT company-scoped, matching every other spec
    table (AC-D.1).

    Append-only in the sense that matters: a verification is one row, stamped once,
    and it is never deleted or re-pointed. Withdrawing it fills the `invalidated_*`
    fields on that same row, so the row still answers both halves of the question -
    who vouched for this, and who (or what) took it back. Re-verifying afterwards
    inserts a NEW row and leaves the withdrawn one exactly as it was.

    `verified_by_user_id` is text with no FK on purpose: a deleted user must not take
    the history of what they verified with them.

    The state a screen shows is DERIVED from these rows (AC-D.2) and never stored: no
    rows reads unverified, an active row reads verified, a latest row invalidated by
    hand reads unverified, and any other invalidation reads needs-re-verify with the
    diff that caused it. Nothing re-hashes values to decide a pill.
