event-registration + predicate machinery lives in

# --- Owned-model mixin ---------------------------------------------------------
class CompanyScopedMixin:
    """Marks an owned business table as partitioned by ``company_id``.

    Every model carrying this mixin is auto-filtered by the ``do_orm_execute``
    event and auto-stamped on insert by the ``before_insert`` event registered in
    ``app.services.company_scope``. The new-table guard (AC-H2) asserts that any
    model with a ``company_id`` column is a subclass of this mixin.

    ``company_id`` is nullable for the backfill window; a later migration flips it
    NOT NULL for every owned table EXCEPT attachments (which stay nullable — a
    null company means a shared form attachment). Models that must remain
    permanently nullable/shared set ``__company_shared__ = True``.

    INTENTIONAL ORM-nullable / PG-NOT-NULL divergence: migration
    ``305_company_composite_unique`` flips ``company_id`` NOT NULL in Postgres for
    every owned table (except attachments), but this column stays
    ``nullable=True`` at the ORM level ON PURPOSE. The test suite builds its
    schema with sqlite ``Base.metadata.create_all`` (no alembic), and owned-row
    fixtures insert before the request-time auto-stamp would fire — a model-level
    NOT NULL would break those inserts. Runtime safety does NOT depend on this
    flag: the ``before_insert`` auto-stamp + ``do_orm_execute`` scope filter
    already guarantee no null-company write escapes on Postgres, where the hard
    constraint lives. Do NOT set ``nullable=False`` here without also fixing every
    owned-inserting test fixture.
