"""Price tag request models.

A portal contact (Sorento salesperson) submits a request naming products, sets,
pricing mode and a dealer. Marketing designs the tags in the canvas editor and
the salesperson reviews the proof on the portal. See PLAN-price-tag-request.md.

``PriceTagRequest`` is company-scoped (``CompanyScopedMixin``).
``PriceTagRequestLine`` is not scoped itself - it hangs off the request.

``ContactPortalFormOverride`` lives here rather than in ``access.py`` because
it is portal-form infrastructure introduced by this feature; the access module
is already large and the override has no coupling to it beyond the FK.
