"""Delete every row the `sales` module owns, when it is uninstalled with purge.

Discovered by ``app.modules.runtime.discovery.discover_module_purge_handlers`` because it is
``app/modules/sales/purge.py`` and exposes ``purge(db)``; same shape and rules as
``app/modules/projects/purge.py``: module-owned tables only (everything declared in
``app/models/sales.py``, all in the ``sales`` schema), children first, core rows never touched
(a purge never deletes a ``public.sales_agents`` row), and never ``DROP SCHEMA``.
``tests/test_sales_module_purge_invariants.py`` pins the list against the models and against
``sorento_crm_frontend/modules/sales/purge_tables.json``. Edit all three together.
