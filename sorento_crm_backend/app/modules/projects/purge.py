"""Delete every row the `projects` module owns, when it is uninstalled with purge (ADR-0009).

Discovered, not registered: ``app.modules.runtime.discovery.discover_module_purge_handlers``
picks this file up because it is ``app/modules/projects/purge.py`` and exposes ``purge(db)``,
and ``app.services.module_purge_service`` merges it onto the key ``projects`` additively. There
is no line to add to the hardcoded ``MODULE_PURGE_HANDLERS`` dict, which is the point: the
module carries its own uninstall story.

Three rules govern what is in here:

* **Module-owned tables only, and the model file is what says so.** All 49 live in the
  ``projects`` Postgres schema (ADR-0011), which is a second, mechanically checkable
  expression of the same fact - but ownership is still "declared in
  ``app/models/projects.py`` or ``app/models/project_so.py``", which is exactly what
  ``tests/test_projects_module_purge_invariants.py`` asserts. Nothing outside the module
  reads any of them.
* **Core rows are never touched.** The ``public.sales_orders`` the demand feed created stay,
  and so do complaints, purchase requests, customers, attachments and statuses. Seven of the
  module's bare names also exist as CORE tables (``brands``, ``purchase_orders``,
  ``purchase_order_lines``, ``sales_orders``, ``sales_order_lines``, ``quotations``,
  ``quotation_lines``); the deletes below name MODEL CLASSES, which carry their schema, so
  there is no way for one of them to land on core's copy. The two core-to-module foreign keys
  (``complaints.project_id``, ``purchase_requests.project_id``) go NULL through
  ``ON DELETE SET NULL`` when the project row dies. That is the mechanism; purge does not
  reach across the boundary to do it by hand.
* **Purge never issues ``DROP SCHEMA``.** It empties tables an operator explicitly consented
  to empty and leaves the (now empty) ``projects`` schema, and every table in it, in place.
  A schema is a namespace here, not a lifetime: signed quotations, customer POs and the sales
  orders behind them are system of record, and an uninstall is not a licence to drop the
  structure that held them.

Deletes go through the ORM model classes rather than raw table names, so a table rename moves
both sides at once. Every one of the 34 prefixed names moved in migration 354 and this file
needed no edit, which is the argument for the pattern.

``PURGE_ORDER`` is children-first over the REAL foreign key graph, not alphabetical. Most of
those FKs are ``CASCADE`` and would take the children anyway, but every table gets its own
statement so the returned counts tell an operator what was actually removed rather than
under-reporting whatever the database quietly swept up. Four ``RESTRICT`` edges make the order
load-bearing and are marked inline below; get one of them wrong and the uninstall fails
half-way through, with the rows it already deleted gone.
