"""The chatbot module's lane and domain vocabulary, published for core (AC-809, AC-931).

The Settings > Chatbot screen has to render one checkbox per branch kind the build can
complete, and `PUT /settings/general` has to refuse one it cannot. Both live in
`app/api/v1/user_management/settings.py`, which is CORE, and core never imports
`app/services/chatbot/` (AC-002, and `tests/chatbot/test_import_boundary.py` fails naming
the importer). So the module publishes what core needs HERE, on its own surface, and the
package import stays on the module's side of the line - which is what `app/modules/chatbot/`
is for.

`contracts` is imported inside the functions and read as a module attribute, not bound at
import time, so it stays the single source: a slice that adds a lane changes `contracts`
and this answers differently on the next call, with nothing to keep in step.
