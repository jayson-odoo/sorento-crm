"""The ledger family of a customer row: the TRADING NAME behind it.

A shop is often several `customers` rows, one per ledger, that differ only by a bracketed
marker: `CHIN CHUN HARDWARE SDN BHD - [A/C I]`, `HANLIM TRADING (JB) SDN BHD (SRT)`. Ledgers
of one name are one customer. `ledger_family_key` is the comparison key two such rows share;
`ledger_family_label` is what the family is called.

Core, not the chatbot package: the chatbot's narrower (`app/services/chatbot/turn/narrow.py`)
groups a customer roster by it, and the stock-ask record (`app/services/stock_ask_service.py`)
names a customer-less ask by it (ASKS-UX item 4). Core must never import
`app.services.chatbot` (`tests/chatbot/test_import_boundary.py`), so the rule lives here and
both import it. Written with string operations rather than regexes because the chatbot's turn
package, which imports it, may not call `re` (AC-1520), and the rule was born there.
