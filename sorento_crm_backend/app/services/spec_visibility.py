"""Which product spec keys (Thickness, Material, ...) the chatbot may reveal to a
contact. Three tiers, resolved here and enforced in
``app.services.chatbot.head.access.check_access`` / ``lanes/business/fetch.py``:

    contact override  >  merged market segments  >  global default

Same doctrine as ``app.services.stock_visibility``, copied mechanically where the
shape matches and diverging on the two points the plan calls out
(PLAN-spec-visibility-policy.md "Decisions"):

* The tier axis is MARKET SEGMENT, not contact access type - the owner's own
  vocabulary for this feature is retail/project.
* ``resolve_policy`` FAILS CLOSED TO THE DEFAULT POLICY on an unresolvable
  contact, never to "no answer" - a stock question with nobody to check against
  gets zero rows and no block, but a spec question always gets an answer.

**The floor is code, not data.** The default row is seeded by migration 510, but
a database built by ``create_all`` (CI) has no seeds, so ``default_policy`` falls
back to the ship-closed ``DEFAULT_HIDDEN_KEYS`` floor rather than to "everything
visible". The migration's seed is a literal (migrations stay frozen and do not
import app code); a test pins the two lists equal so they cannot drift apart
silently.
