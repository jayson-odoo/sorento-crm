"""Ideation brain extractor (D-CONFIRM) - the sorento-side NLU for `ideate` turns.

shared-service `create_idea` runs NO LLM: it composes the echo/summary and owns the
durable draft, but it needs sorento to hand it STRUCTURED updates, never free text
to parse. So each `ideate` turn we run one small, schema-forced LLM step that reads
the user's message in the context of the current draft (its status, still-missing
required fields, the next optional field to ask, and any duplicate candidate) and
emits:

    { fields, use_cases, remove, skip, title, review_action, change_text, duplicate_choice }

- ``fields`` - answer-key -> value updates the user just supplied. R17 (owner ruling,
  24 Sep 2026): the field a message updates is decided by the MEANING of the whole
  draft so far, never by which field ``next_field`` happened to ask - the hint is
  only a hint. A message that reads as more problem detail updates ``problem`` even
  while ``desired_outcome`` was the one asked (AC-1219). The keys are exactly
  ``problem`` / ``desired_outcome`` / ``current_workaround`` (IDEA-CAPTURE, 13 Oct).
- ``use_cases`` - the concrete situations the user named, as plain strings (at most 5,
  never suggested by the model); empty when none.
- ``remove`` - answer keys the user asked to clear ("remove who", "forget the module").
- ``skip`` - OPTIONAL answer keys the user explicitly declined ("skip", "don't know",
  "later", "dunno lah"). Never ``problem`` - the one required field can't be skipped
  (deterministic guard below, AC-1205).
- ``title`` - a short label (at most 8 words) generated from the idea text, cut
  deterministically below if the model runs long (AC-1202). Empty string when the
  draft has no problem statement yet.
- ``review_action`` - ``"submit" | "change" | "cancel" | "none"``, meaningful only
  while the draft is in ``review``: ``submit`` on an explicit "yes/ok/boleh/submit/
  confirm"; ``change`` when the user is editing a captured field (the edit itself
  goes in ``fields``, the request text in ``change_text``); ``cancel`` when the user
  wants to drop the draft - honoured at ANY step, not only during review (AC-1211).
- ``change_text`` - the user's own words describing the change, set only alongside
  ``review_action == "change"``.
- ``duplicate_choice`` - ``"vote" | "separate" | "none"``, meaningful only while the
  draft is ``duplicate_candidate``: ``vote`` on an explicit vote for the existing
  idea, ``separate`` on an explicit "keep mine separate", ``none`` when the message
  does not address the choice at all (the caller defaults ``none`` to ``separate``
  per R4 - AC-1214).

``confirm`` is no longer read from the model (AC-1201): it is DERIVED here from
``review_action`` and the draft's status, so there is exactly one place (this
function) that decides it - the old draft flow read ``.confirm`` off the result.

Reuses the same provider plumbing as before (``get_provider`` + ``json_schema``
forced output) and the prompt registry (``ideate_extractor`` key). On any failure
(no api key, provider/parse error) it degrades to an EMPTY extraction so the turn
still calls ``create_idea`` with ``message_text`` - never raises.
