"""L3 - migrating the Order Inquiry sheet into the worklist.

**Project Sales module code.** Ownership moved here from `app/services/scm/` per ADR 0010:
the whole Order Inquiry loop - derive, export, human edit, import - belongs to Project Sales,
and SCM keeps the role it already had, reader of core `sales_orders`. Only the service layer
moved: the route path `/api/v1/scm/order-inquiry/*` and the permission `scm.reorder.run` are
deliberately unchanged so the FE upload dialog keeps working (the route file now holds a thin
shim onto this module).

**What this sheet is now** (`PLAN-scm-oi-sheet-migration.md`, owner ruling 13 Sep 2026):
a MIGRATION TOOL. Sales orders, purchase orders and shipping orders already arrive from
AutoCount in real time, so the book is not this file's to write any more. What AutoCount does
not hold is the operator's own Excel: which sales-order line is owed where, and which purchase
or shipping order it is waiting on. So this importer:

  * creates NO sales order and NO sales-order line, and writes no `warehouse_id` (D4);
  * RAISES one order inquiry row against any NOT-CANCELLED sales order line of the
    sheet's own order - a closed or fully delivered line is a candidate again (R1, 23 Sep
    2026, `PLAN-oi-order-rows-uncapped.md`, SO421985: the row is owed in full until it
    is linked, whatever the line's own delivered column says, so a delivered line is
    replenishment, not history). Only CANCELLED is refused (AC-S4-3, narrowed from R4's
    21 Sep "closed or cancelled" reading);
  * PAIRS that row to the document AutoCount's own ingest already states for the line (D9),
    following a purchase order through to the shipping order it became (D10). The sheet's
    remark pairs NOTHING and picks no line (section 8 of the pairing-repair plan, owner
    15 Sep 2026: "let's ignore the sheet remark at all"); it is kept on the row's note, so a
    person can still read what the sheet said;
  * opens NO claim of its own: the claim beside a link is written by the one link writer
    (`ProjectOrderInquiryService._write_link`), and nothing else here writes one.

**How that pairing is read** (`PLAN-scm-oi-sheet-pairing-repair.md`, owner rulings R1 to R3,
14 Sep 2026). The purchase side carries the exact sales order line it was raised for, in its
own column: `purchase_order_lines.from_so_line_ref` and the `spo_allocations` twin, both
joinable to `sales_order_lines.source_ref`. That column is read FIRST, because it is exact,
already persisted, and is what the owner's own query reads. Claims are the fallback for the
documents AutoCount stated only by NUMBER: a claim is one row per
`(so_number, po_number, item_code)` and never repoints, so it cannot say "line 3 to purchase
order A, line 4 to purchase order B" for two same-item lines, and on the 14 Sep prod copy the
August `po_history` extract already held the claim key for 28,397 pairings the column states
exactly, which is why `po_history` pairs nothing any more.

**WHICH line of the order a row lands on** is R4 (owner, 21 Sep 2026,
`PLAN-board-received-stock-own-arrival.md` S4, `_pick_lines_by_date_order`), narrowed by
R1 (23 Sep 2026, `PLAN-oi-order-rows-uncapped.md`): its NOT-CANCELLED lines sorted by
`required_date`, this upload's own rows for that order sorted by `delivery_date`, paired
one to one in that order; a row beyond the last candidate line lands on the LAST one as a
second row. Only a CANCELLED line is never a candidate (AC-S4-3). An order with no
candidate line at all (every line cancelled, or none exist) refuses its rows with their
own reason, `order_fully_delivered` (R9, AC-S4-6), never the genuine-item-mismatch
`no_line_for_item`.
Item and location still gate a candidate as they always have (`_match_row`); **quantity gates
the ORDER, not the line** (R10, AC-S4-7): a row bigger than the line its date order gives it
still lands there, with a "Was {qty} on {date}" note recording what the book holds, and only a
row bigger than the whole order's remaining open quantity is refused `qty_exceeds_ordered`.

The five citation/month passes this pick replaced (`PLAN-oi-sheet-line-pick-month-po.md`, 19
Sep 2026) and every helper that served them are GONE from this file as of the 21 Sep review
round; nothing read them after R4 landed. `_pair`'s own document linking still reads
`plan.bought_rows`, which is a different question and unchanged.

Three honest limits, each counted and named rather than smoothed over.

**A row can only be raised against a line that exists.** A sales order the CRM does not hold
is named under `sales_orders_not_found` and nothing is invented for it; a row whose item,
location or quantity fits no line of that order is reported with the FIRST reason it failed.

**A row whose item had a free line before this walk began raises as a SECOND row on whichever
line the date order gives it; otherwise it restates the line's existing row.** A line already
carrying a row is not a FREE candidate, but it still takes a second row once the date-order
pick runs out of free ones (AC-S4-2) - and a row pushed onto an occupied line purely because
an earlier row of this same walk claimed its own item's free line first is genuinely new news,
never absorbed as `already_raised` (AC-LP-12). Where the row's item had no free line at all,
the sheet is a migration rather than a source of truth about rows somebody has since worked
on, so the existing row is restated in place (`_restated_existing`, D2) and a re-upload of the
SAME instruction writes nothing new.

**A genuine typo inside one tab still raises twice** (R5, 19 Sep 2026: a restatement is only
ever across tabs, never within one). A row a person mistyped rather than meant to split is
indistinguishable here from a real second delivery, so it raises like one, and is only reported
(`qty_exceeds_ordered`) once it overflows what the ORDER can hold.

`SOURCE_SYSTEM` below stays the literal `'scm_order_inquiry'`. The string is baked into raw
SQL (`scm/demand.py`), into migration 346's backfill and into the `OrderLinkClaim` CHECK
constraint, and the 12 sales orders older uploads created still carry it, so renaming it would
be a data migration that buys no correctness.

    The customer keeps one book with a month tab, a roll-up tab covering that month and a
    dated working snapshot, so the same delivery is written out two and three times by
    design. Sales order, item, quantity, delivery date and location is the whole key (owner
    ruling R3, 14 Sep 2026: "the remark doesn't really matter, differing remark is same also
    as long as other keys are the same"); anything that differs on those five - a quantity, a
    date, a location - is the sheet splitting the line, which AC-S1-2 says it may.

    The remark, the documents parsed out of it and the ORDER BACK flag are all OUT of the
    key. Which tab carries the purchase order number is an accident of how the book is kept,
    so a roll-up row that names one is the same instruction as the month row that left it
    blank - and `_plan` lends that citation onto the FIRST statement of the pair when that
    one carries none, before either row ever reaches the line pick. A first statement that
    already cites its own purchase order keeps it - lending never overwrites a citation, only
    fills the gap the blank tab left. An ORDER BACK row carries no delivery date at all, so
    the date still tells it apart from a dated row.

    R3's "the remark doesn't matter" was about ONE delivery written on a month tab, a
    roll-up tab and a dated snapshot - never about two IDENTICAL rows inside the SAME tab.
    Measured, 19 Sep 2026 (R5, prod CB1178A-SS-NEW / SO324265): the order holds two lines of
    qty 25 on the same delivery date (two unit types), and the sheet states that delivery
    TWICE inside one tab, then twice again on the roll-up. Reading `_restates`' key alone
    per row, as `_plan` used to, collapsed all four into ONE instruction and raised only one
    of the two lines; book-wide, 517 keys are stated more than once inside a single tab, 650
    deliveries are dropped as restatements, across 90 sales orders.

    A restatement is only ever ACROSS tabs. Inside one tab, the n-th row carrying a given key
    is its own instruction, distinct from every other row that shares the key on that SAME
    tab; on a LATER tab, the n-th row carrying that key restates the n-th instruction (first
    tab's first occurrence, second tab's first occurrence, and so on by position) rather than
    every occurrence on the later tab piling onto the first. The number of instructions a key
    holds is therefore the MAX count that key reaches on any single tab, not the count summed
    across every tab in the file. `_plan` keeps this by pairing `_restates`' key with the
    row's own `sheet` in a per-(sheet, key) counter, so two identical rows in one tab are two
    instructions and a later tab's own identical rows restate them positionally.

    customer always sells together, written as one row though AutoCount holds it as
    SEPARATE lines, one per member, each at the cell's own quantity. Splitting is the only
    way those rows ever raise.

    A cell that IS a line's own product code is never split - four real codes on the book

    Item, then location, then quantity - reported in that order because that is the order a
    person checks them in, and "no line for this item" and "location differs" send them to
    two different places.

    R10 (owner, 21 Sep 2026, `PLAN-board-received-stock-own-arrival.md`): **line quantity
    does not gate the pairing.** The quantity test is against what the ORDER still holds
    open across every line this row could land on - each candidate's `qty_ordered` less what
    EARLIER rows of this same file already took of it, summed - never against one line's
    own. A sheet row bigger than the line its date order gives it still lands there, and the
    difference is the ordinary "Was {qty} on {date}" note the raise writes; what stays
    refused as `qty_exceeds_ordered` is a row bigger than the order itself can hold, which is
    a true report about the sheet rather than an accident of how the order was split into
    lines. Before R10 the per-line test filtered the row's own line out of `same_place`
    before the date order ever got a say, and SO372176's OCT26/70 landed on L11 (120 @ Dec
    2027) instead of L2 (20 @ Oct 2026) for want of 50 units of line capacity.

    The ledger is charged for whatever line a row lands on, ALREADY RAISED or not - reversing
    review finding 9 (14 Sep) on purpose (PLAN section 2, "Ledger"). Finding 9 had this skip
    the charge on an already-raised line so the NEXT row of the same file would not read
    `qty_exceeds_ordered` for quantity nobody used, but the pick runs the identical ledger on
    a fresh upload and on every re-upload of the same file (a line raised by an EARLIER run
    is "already raised" on both), so a charge that only happens sometimes is a charge that
    lets the two runs place a later row on two different lines (AC-LP-11, AC-LP-13).
    Charging always keeps them in step; the only new `qty_exceeds_ordered` this can produce
    is a sheet that states more against an order than the order actually holds, which is a
    true report (AC-LP-12).

    replacing the five citation/month passes this file used until 21 Sep 2026 (now deleted,
    along with every helper only they read - the review round of the same day). D8 ("closed
    and fully delivered lines migrate too") and R7's "a cancelled line may still be taken by
    the fallback, when it is the only line that fits" are BOTH superseded for this pick: a
    CANCELLED line is never a candidate here, not even as a last resort (AC-S4-3).

    R1 (23 Sep 2026, `PLAN-oi-order-rows-uncapped.md`, SO421985) narrows AC-S4-3's OWN
    21 Sep reading in the other direction: a CLOSED or delivered-in-full line is a
    candidate again - an ORDER row against it is replenishment, owed in full until it is
    linked, whatever the line's own delivered column says. `_close_history`
    (`project_order_inquiry_import_service.py`, retired with this change - see its former
    call site below) used to be what stopped such a row counting as live demand forever;
    R1 retired the need for that trick along with the cap it was compensating for. Only
    CANCELLED is still refused.

    One sales order at a time: its NOT-CANCELLED lines, sorted by `required_date`; this upload's own
    pending rows for that order, sorted by `delivery_date` (undated last, file order
    breaking a tie), paired one to one in that order onto whichever candidate line is not
    yet taken - by an earlier import (`raised_already`) or by an earlier row of this SAME
    walk. A row beyond the last such line lands on the LAST candidate line as a second row,
    whatever it already carries (AC-S4-2). Item and location still gate a candidate exactly
    as `_match_row` always has (reused unchanged, so `no_line_for_item` and `location_differs`
    report exactly as before) - the date order only decides which of the lines `_match_row`
    would accept a row lands on.

    A row that already states exactly what a live row on the order already carries
    (`_restated_existing`) never reaches the date-order pick at all: it restates that row in
    place (D2 kept, AC-S4-4), so a re-upload of an unchanged book raises nothing new and
    never crowds a later, genuinely new row off the line it should take.

    Fix round, 21 Sep 2026 (AC-LP-12 "bumped", a genuine regression the tester's own R4
    reconciliation found and left red rather than inventing a rule to close it): a row that
    is NOT a restatement, and is bumped onto a line already carrying a row ONLY because this
    walk's own earlier rows spent its OWN ITEM's genuinely free candidate(s) first
    (`row_has_free` - at least one line matching this row's item carried no row before this
    walk began), is RAISED as a second row rather than silently absorbed as `already_raised`.

    Scoped to the row's own ITEM (round 2 of this fix round, AC-RB-21's journey test), never
    the whole order: an order can hold a genuinely free line for a DIFFERENT product while
    this row's own item has none at all, and an order-wide reading wrongly read THAT as
    licence to skip the used-row recovery a re-upload after a real Confirm still needs.

    Deliberately NOT the rule for an item with no free candidate at all (AC-LP-12 "charge",
    AC-6 and the rest of `test_oi_sheet_date_follow_sheet.py`'s single-already-raised-line
    fixtures): there, `already_raised` is set exactly as before this fix round, so D2's
    repair (`_resolve_delivery_date_repairs`), used-row and top-up recovery
    (`_resolve_recovery_matches`) still get first say over the row, unchanged - `row_has_
    free` is a distinction the OLD per-line `already_raised` never had a reason to draw, so
    gating on it touches nothing that mechanism already owned.

    R10 (owner, 21 Sep 2026, same plan) then took the LINE's quantity out of this pick
    altogether: `_match_row`'s ceiling is now what the whole ORDER still holds open across
    the lines this row could land on, never one line's own. A row larger than the line its
    date order gives it lands there regardless, and the difference is written as a "Was
    {qty} on {date}" note (`_note_for`) - on SO372176 that is what puts OCT26's 70 on L2 (20
    @ Oct 2026) rather than a year away on L11 (120 @ Dec 2027), which was the last thing
    still mis-pairing after R4. A row larger than the order itself can hold is still
    refused `qty_exceeds_ordered` (AC-S1-5, AC-M-8): that is a true statement about the
    sheet, not an accident of how the order was split into lines.

    mistake) - the sheet says 182 @ 1.6.2026, which describes the row's WAS state, not a
    fresh instruction.

    Pure and deterministic, over `previous_qty` instead of `qty` - but only for sheet rows
    shape A left with nothing to do: "exact match first, shape A, then shape B" (round 5
    review), so a row shape A already claimed - whether repaired or settled as an exact
    no-op match (`shape_a_exact_matched`, `_resolve_line_repairs`'s own second return value,
    N10 round 4 review) - is never also handed to shape B.

    Its OWN pass 1 (S14, round 4 review): a settled candidate whose `previous_delivery_date`
    already equals the sheet's date needs no repair - claimed as a no-op, same as shape A's,
    so it is not ALSO reported `DELIVERY_DATE_UPDATED` and counted on every further run while
    nothing actually changes.

    round 6 premise (stamp + `changed_at` + no Was, on ONE row) never actually occurs.

    The real shape, SO314593's CB2806A-DIY / SRTWB245: a reconfirm CANCELLED a migrated
    row that had ALREADY been settled in place once (qty 220, `previous_qty` 182,
    `previous_delivery_date` 2027-03-01 - its OWN Was, from that earlier settle) and its
    note overwritten to `"Superseded by revision N"` (`_settle_row_in_place`'s cancel path
    replaces the note outright - the migration stamp is GONE, so a cancelled sibling can
    never be found by it), then RAISED A FRESH LIVE ROW in its place (qty 220,
    `delivery_date` the line's own `required_date`, no Was at all, no stamp - board-raised,
    not migrated). The sheet's 182 @ 1.6.2026 is the Was the live row never got, because it
    REPLACES a migrated row rather than being one.

    A sheet row is paired to a LIVE row through a CANCELLED, migrated SIBLING on the SAME
    mirror whose OWN quantity - its `qty` (never settled before being superseded) OR its
    `previous_qty` (settled once, then superseded) - equals the sheet row's own quantity:
    that identity is what says "this sheet row is about the SAME instruction that migrated
    row was." Only a sibling `import_job_rows` itself records as a row this feature CREATED
    (`entity_type="order_inquiry_row"`, `outcome="created"`, `entity_id` = the row's own id -
    the same durable record `outcome.success(...)` writes for every row it raises) ever
    counts as a migrated sibling (S1, round 7 review round 2): the cancel path overwrites the
    note, so a plain cancelled BOARD row can otherwise coincidentally share a quantity with a
    sheet row and be mistaken for one.

    The live row adopted is the unclaimed live candidate whose OWN `qty` equals the
    sibling's own `qty` (S2, round 7 review round 2) - prod's own shape (sibling `qty` 220,
    live `qty` 220) - falling back to the first unclaimed candidate sharing the sibling's
    item code only when no quantity match exists. NEVER by file position (round 7 review):
    two live rows and two cancelled siblings of the same item are paired by which sibling's
    own quantity the sheet row's own quantity matches, not by which pair happens to line up
    positionally.

    Claim-once on BOTH pools - "one live row per cancelled migrated sibling" - so a second
    live row cannot ride on a sibling a first live row already used, and a second sibling
    carrying the same quantity is what a second live row needs. Only for sheet rows shapes
    A and B leave unclaimed (`already_claimed` is their combined claim set) - "exact match,
    shape A, shape B, shape C" is the full priority order.

    No pass-1 no-op: `previous_qty IS NULL` can never already equal the sheet's own
    (non-`NULL`) quantity, so idempotency comes from the eligibility precondition itself -
    once this writes `previous_qty`/`previous_delivery_date`, the row no longer carries
    `previous_qty IS NULL` and drops out of the candidate pool on the next run entirely.

    **S8, confined to 7.4's own artefacts.** Shape A is eligible only when the migrated
    row's `delivery_date` still equals its CORE LINE's `required_date` - that is exactly
    what 7.4 wrote and nothing else does. A row that already carries a date the line does
    not (a sheet date raised under this fix, or one a person edited) is never rewritten by a
    later sheet: the sheet is a migration, not a second opinion. Compared in PYTHON against
    `required_date_by_mirror`, not a SQL clause (S13, 19 Sep 2026 perf round): `delivery_date`
    is not indexed, so at prod scale (11,500 already-raised mirrors on a full book
    re-upload) an `OR`-of-per-line-equality clause is an 1.1 MB statement forcing a Seq Scan
    (measured 753 ms) where `so_line_id.in_(mirror_ids)` alone still uses the index.

    **Shape B, round 5 (19 Sep 2026, prod feedback after #1004 deployed).** A migrated row a
    planning change already restated IN PLACE (`_settle_row_in_place`) keeps its Now
    correct but can still carry 7.4's mistake on its WAS side - `previous_qty` /
    `previous_delivery_date` are the migration's own figures, never touched by the settle
    except to be overwritten by it, so they carry the SAME fingerprint shape A looks for on
    the other pair of columns: `previous_delivery_date == required_date`, and the sheet's
    quantity is compared against `previous_qty`, not the row's current `qty`. Written by
    `_resolve_shape_b_repairs`; see `apply()` for what actually moves (only
    `previous_delivery_date` and the note's own "Was ... on" fragment - the row's Now,
    `changed_at` and `ack_state` are all untouched).

    A purchase order line and the shipping order it became are ONE supply. D10 links the
    shipment first and the line "for the remainder", but the remainder was measured against
    the line's whole `qty_ordered`, so the same units were owed twice: on the 3am prod copy
    555 rows carried a link to a PO line AND to that line's own allocation, 23,187 units
    counted twice (SO368872 / SRTWC286-SH is the owner's own case, 62 on PO 202510-S0078 and
    62 on SPO-2026/04-0043, which IS that line shipped).

    So the line's capacity drops by what its own allocations carry: ONLY the allocations
    that quote this line's `source_ref` in `from_po_line_ref`, never the document's own
    (reviewer B1, 15 Sep). Deducting the document's took a SIBLING line's shipment off this
    line and left a row with no link at all when that sibling's allocation was already
    occupied. On the 3am prod copy the fallback could not help anyway: 0 allocations carry a
    `from_po_number` without a `from_po_line_ref`, and 0 purchase order lines have a blank
    `source_ref`, so an allocation that really came from this line always names it.

    `_through_po` still walks the document's allocations when the feed named no line, which
    is D10 as it has always been (AC-R-2, AC-R-9). The two are not in conflict: an allocation
    that does not name this line is not evidence that this line's units have sailed, so it
    must not reduce the line, while taking it first is still the right walk when it is all
    the feed states. Floored at zero, and read off the facts already built for those
    allocations, so nothing is queried again.

    The owner still sees both documents: "we definitely cannot double count, but by this
    linking it helps us to know the PO and SPO corresponding to this order inquiry". The
    worklist's PO column names the source purchase order of a shipment it links (7.2, FE).

    """What each need would be linked to, in the order the two sources rank.

    Extracted from `_pair` (S1, `PLAN-oi-follow-book-chain.md`) with no behaviour
    change for the importer (AC-FB-12): `_pair` builds its own `needs` from
    `plan.matches` and calls this. The seam exists so a LIVE order inquiry row
    (`ProjectOrderInquiryService.follow_book_for_rows`) can run through the exact
    same rule a migrated row does, keyed by its own row id rather than a match's
    index into a sheet that does not exist for it.

    **Source 1, the line reference AutoCount itself wrote** (D9 as repaired, R1: "we don't
    trust the remark column in the sheet ... the source of truth is the autocount linkage").
    The purchase side names the exact sales order line in its own column, so that column is
    read FIRST: allocations that name the line, then, for a purchase order line that names
    it, the shipping orders that purchase order became (D10) and the purchase order line
    itself only for what they cannot cover. Measured on the 3am 14 Sep prod copy, 32,674
    purchase order lines name a held sales order line and only 4,277 carry a claim saying so.

    **Source 2, claims the ingest resolved** - for the need the reference leaves. Where
    AutoCount stated only a document NUMBER there is no reference to read, and the claim is
    all there is, so this source stays; it is merely no longer first, and `po_history` no
    longer counts as the book (`_BOOK_CLAIM_SOURCES`). SPO before PO, a purchase order
    followed through to the allocations it became before the purchase-order line itself.

    **There is no third source.** What the sheet's remark cites used to answer for the need
    the book left; it does not any more (section 8, owner 15 Sep 2026: "let's ignore the
    sheet remark at all"). 223 of the 5,833 links on the 14 Sep prod copy came from it, and
    the documents it named were read by number alone, which took units off lines the purchase
    order had cancelled. `documents_not_linkable` therefore comes back empty from every run,
    and stays on the result only so the contract keeps its keys.

    Nothing is written here. `apply` writes exactly what this returns, and `preview` counts
    it, so the two can never answer differently. `follow_book_for_rows` is the third caller
    that keeps that same promise: nothing is written until it decides to write it.

    `book_targets_out` (review round item 4, security B1 / reviewer blocker 3): when given a
    dict, this fills it with `{core_line_id: [(target_id, fact), ...]}` for SOURCE-1 (the
    ref, direct or through the PO -> SPO chain) ONLY - never a claim - in the exact rank this
    walk reads them, `fact` already netted (`_target_facts` + `_less_own_shipments`), whether
    or not `take()` could actually place anything on it. This is the one list of "what the
    book names for this line" `follow_book_for_rows`'s own displacement reads (`_book_targets_
    map` and its own re-derived, un-netted capacity query are retired in favour of it -
    PRINCIPLES "one copy"): a second walk of the same primitives could only ever answer the
    same question differently by accident.
