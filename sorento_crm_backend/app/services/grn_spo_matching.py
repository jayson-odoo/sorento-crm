"""One matcher, two directions: GRN lines <-> SPO allocations.

AutoCount emits the SPO allocation file and the GRN detail listing independently,
and the office receives them on whatever schedule the supplier and the warehouse
produce them. Which one lands first is not a decision anybody makes, so it must
not decide whether the link is ever made.

Going FORWARDS, the GRN lines import draws each line's quantity from the pool of
allocations for its SPO and product. Going BACKWARDS,
``forward_match_grn_lines_for_spo`` runs the same draw over the lines a previous
import stated (``picking_lines.spo_number_raw``) but could not place, the moment
an allocation for that SPO appears. Both call ``build_allocation_pool`` and
``draw_fifo`` here - a second copy of the two-pass rule is exactly how the two
directions would come to disagree, and disagreeing is the bug.

# THE CONVENTION, and why it is this one.
#
# The quantity a picking line drew from its allocation is ``quantity_picked``.
# Every writer also sets ``quantity_expected`` to the same value on the rows it
# creates by splitting one receipt across allocations, so the GRN import and
# ``_create_grn_lines_with_spo_fifo`` produce the same rows for the same receipt
# (AC-FM-19 compares ``quantity_expected``); a receipt split across allocations
# therefore cannot carry an expected-vs-picked discrepancy, while an unsplit line
# still can.
#
# The READERS - this pool and ``compute_received_for_allocation`` - measure
# ``quantity_picked``, because it is the only column that is right on the rows
# ALREADY in the database. ``_create_grn_lines_with_spo_fifo`` used to leave the
# whole document quantity on a split's first chunk and write 0 on every later one,
# so a reader measuring ``quantity_expected`` charged the entire draw to the first
# allocation and nothing to the rest: capacity that had already been given up was
# offered again, and the allocation that got the first chunk reported a receipt it
# had not had. ``quantity_picked`` always held the per-chunk draw, so choosing it
# needs no backfill of the existing corpus.

    """The capacity available under ``spo_number`` for ``product_id``, FIFO.

    ``company_id`` confines the pool to one company. The session scope normally
    does that, but the ``X-API-Key`` principal resolves to a NULL scope ("all
    companies") and then adds no predicate at all, so without this an allocation
    belonging to one company is offered to another company's GRN line. Passing it
    is how the caller says which company's capacity it is asking about.

    Availability is COMPUTED, not read off ``spo_allocations.quantity_received``:

    - stored ``quantity_received`` is only written when a GRN is APPROVED, and an
      imported GRN normally is not, so a line already linked to an allocation
      would leave the stored figure at 0 and forward matching would hand the same
      capacity out a second time;
    - ``compute_received_for_allocation`` counts approved headers only, so it has
      the same hole.

    So each allocation's consumption is the sum of the DRAWN quantity (see the
    convention note above) over the picking lines linked to it, REGARDLESS of
    approval status - except lines on a REJECTED GRN, which must not consume
    capacity (the same rule the forward-match candidate filter states) - plus
    whatever
    receipt the stored column claims that no picking line explains (an
    integration's write - real stock, and it must still consume capacity).
    Subtracting the linked total before taking that excess is what stops a
    re-import of an APPROVED GRN seeing an empty pool and unlinking its own lines.

    ``exclude_header_ids`` is what makes a re-import idempotent: a GRN never
    competes with itself. Across DIFFERENT GRNs the exclusion does not apply, so a
    second GRN correctly sees the first one's draw.
