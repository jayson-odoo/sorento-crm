"""Voice transcription (PLAN section 5).

No transcription code existed anywhere in this repo - zero hits for
`whisper|transcrib|speech_to_text` across `app/` - so this is the one place the
"reuse what transfers" instruction had nothing to transfer.

The language strategy is built **from settings at call time**, never baked in:

* `pinned` sends `language: <media_language_pinned>`. This is the default, and
  with `whisper-1` + `en` it reproduces today's spine behaviour exactly. The pin
  stays until the captain says otherwise; what ships is the ability to change it
  without a deploy.
* `hints` sends a `languages` list, for a model that accepts one.
* `auto` sends neither.

A `languages` array on the response is recorded and returned, so switching to a
model that reports what it detected is a settings change rather than a code
change. An **empty** array is a valid "the model could not make a reliable
prediction" signal and is propagated as such - not as an error, and not as
silence. `None` means the model said nothing about the language at all; `[]`
means it said it was unsure. They are different answers and the distinction is
kept.

Two operational traps, recorded so they are not rediscovered:

* the upload filename must carry a usable extension, because the API infers the
  audio format from it. `filename_for` derives one from the mime type, falling
  back to the URL and finally to `.ogg`.
* WhatsApp voice notes are Opus in an Ogg container, and acceptance varies by
  model. A provider rejection is surfaced with the **provider's own message**
  rather than a generic error, so a failed callback says why.
