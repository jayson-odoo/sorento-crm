"""Onboarding requests: minting, intake, review, approval.

Module-level functions rather than a class, matching ``dealer_kit.edition_service``
- the service this one's transition machinery is copied from.

Two things are worth reading before the code.

**Every move goes through the status engine.** ``_move`` re-reads the row under a
row lock, asks ``status_service.assert_transition_allowed``, and only then stamps
whatever the transition records. That is what makes a second Approve a refusal
rather than a race: two clicks both pass a plain ``if request.status_key ==
"in_review"`` check against the same pre-state and the second one enqueues a
second provisioning job.

**Collisions are computed, never stored.** ``collisions_for`` runs three live
queries against the unique keys that would actually reject an insert
(``users.email``, ``users.contact_number``, ``respond_contacts.phone_number``). A
stored collision is a lie the moment somebody creates that user by hand, and the
review screen is exactly where a stale answer does damage.
