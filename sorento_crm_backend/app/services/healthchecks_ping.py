"""Heartbeat pings to Healthchecks.io (HA-MONITOR).

An outside service that alerts when a ping stops arriving. The ping must never be
able to hurt the caller: no URL means nothing happens, the HTTP call has a short
timeout, it runs on its own daemon thread (the caller never waits on it), and every
error is swallowed into a log line. The ping URL itself is never logged, because
anyone holding it can fake a heartbeat. That is why this uses urllib and not httpx:
httpx logs every request's full URL at INFO, and the worker logs INFO.
