"""Which RESTRICTED chatbot fields a contact may be told, and the keys that exist.

One mechanism for two owner requirements (chatbot growth r1, Slice C): sellable
stock defaults off for every contact (D3), and a PO's supplier must never reach a
dealer by default (D4). A presenter marks a field `restricted=<key>` in
`field_vocabulary`; `contact_field_reveals` is the grant, keyed directly on the
contact - unlike `agent_field_access`, there is no owning agent to route a PO
supplier's reveal through.

Default is HIDDEN, except the DO keys (`DEFAULT_ON_KEYS`), which default ON for every
contact (owner, 4 Oct 2026): a contact with no row for any other key never sees that field,
and a `granted=False` row hides a DO key. A full
list PUT does not delete non-listed rows - it flips them to `granted=False` - so
the table keeps who granted or revoked a key and when, rather than losing that
history on the next save.

WHICH KEYS EXIST is a frozen literal here, not a read of `mcp_tools.restricted_fields`
at request time. `mcp_tool_registry_service.sync_catalog` still writes that column at
startup by importing `sorento_crm_mcp.catalog` - but the deployed backend image is built
from `context: ./sorento_crm_backend` only (see `sorento_crm/docker-compose.yml` and
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`), `sorento_crm_mcp` is not in `requirements.txt`, and no
volume mounts it in, so that import raises `ModuleNotFoundError` in every container and
the startup sync never runs - the column stays at its migration-488 default of `[]`
forever on prod, and this checklist read "No restricted field exists yet" even though the
catalogue declares three. A local checkout works because the dev venv happens to have the
MCP package installed, which is exactly what hid the bug. The precedent is
`app/services/chatbot/lanes/business/fetch.py::CHATBOT_READ_ONLY_TOOLS`: a frozen set the
container CAN read, kept honest by a CI test (`tests/chatbot/test_field_reveal_keys_pinned_to_catalog.py`)
that imports the catalogue - which CI and a checkout both can - and asserts the two agree.
