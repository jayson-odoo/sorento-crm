"""Sales report: confirmed vs outstanding sales, by month.

`documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-chatbot-sales-report.md` ("Backend contract");
`documentation/plans/chatbot/chatbot-sales-report-acceptance-criteria.md`
AC-1620 to AC-1632, rulings S15 to S20 (S19: 19 Sep 2026 live-testing fix
round - `product_code` is now a PREFIX, `_resolve_products`, not a single
exact match; S20: same day, second live-testing round - a product filter
covering 2+ codes ALSO wants `by_product`, even alongside a named customer,
so `by_product` and `by_customer` are no longer mutually exclusive).

AGGREGATED IN SQL, not rolled up from raw rows in Python (SEC-B2/ruling S17): a
big dealer is 1,230 SOs over 37 months (UAC "Measured"), thousands of lines - too
many to read into the request process for one WhatsApp reply. Grouped queries,
each `GROUP BY`, so a total can never drift from the SAME per-line SQL
expressions:

* `_breakdown_query` - one row per (month, breakdown key), called ONCE PER
  breakdown key wanted (S20: up to two, `by_product` and `by_customer`, never
  materialising raw lines to build both from one pass). Neither wanted (both
  subjects named, one covered code) falls back to a single query grouped by
  month alone. Month TOTALS are the Python sum of whichever breakdown ran
  first - summing already-computed SQL sums, not re-deriving them from raw
  lines, and never drifting between the two breakdowns because `product_id`
  is NOT NULL/FK-RESTRICT (the `by_product` query's inner join to `Product`
  drops no row the `by_customer` query would otherwise have kept).
* `_so_count_query` - one row per month, `COUNT(DISTINCT sales_order_id)`. A
  SEPARATE query because a DISTINCT count cannot be summed from the breakdown
  rows above (the same SO can carry lines under more than one product/customer
  in the same month, and `so_count` must still count it once).
* `_so_rows_query` - one row per SO, computed ONLY when `detail == "so"`
  (a big dealer is 1,230 SOs, never built unasked).

Per line (S2, S15, S16 rulings), expressed as SQL so every aggregate is a SUM of
figures already at cent precision, never an exact fraction rounded once at the
end:

* `bucket` = `required_date`, else the SO's `order_date` (S3). A line with
  NEITHER is excluded from EVERYTHING - not just `months[]` but `so_rows[]` too
  (S16) - via a `WHERE bucket IS NOT NULL`, no further fallback to `created_at`.
* `confirmed_qty = LEAST(qty_delivered, qty_ordered)` - never more than ordered.
* `confirmed_value = ROUND(line_total * confirmed_qty / NULLIF(qty_ordered, 0), 2)`,
  0 when `qty_ordered` is 0 or `line_total` is NULL (never a division error) -
  rounded to the cent PER LINE (S15), so every total is a SUM of cents.
* `outstanding_qty` / `outstanding_value` are the REST of the line, counted
  ONLY while the header is `status='open'` AND the line is `line_status='open'`
  - a closed-but-underdelivered line (a data anomaly, not a real one in this
  schema) simply reports less than its `line_total`, rather than raising.
* `ordered = confirmed + outstanding`, by construction (S2).

Company scoping still applies: every query below is a plain ORM query over the
mapped, company-scoped classes (`SalesOrder`, `SalesOrderLine`, ...), so the
`do_orm_execute` scope listener injects its own criteria the same way a raw
Python-rollup query would have - never raw text SQL, which that listener cannot
see.
