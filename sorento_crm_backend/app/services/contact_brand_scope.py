"""Which brands a WhatsApp contact may see: the one reader of `respond_contacts.brand_ids`.

NULL or an empty array means every brand (unscoped, the answer is `None`). A non-empty list
is a strict allow-list APPLIED PER COMPANY (BRAND-SCOPE-PER-COMPANY, owner ruling 6 Oct 2026):
it restricts only the products of a company that owns at least one brand in the list; a
product of any other company passes untouched (Mocha has no brand rows, so a dual Sorento +
Mocha contact scoped to the Sorento brands sees every Mocha product). Within a restricted
company a product whose brand is not in the list, or has no brand at all, is out of scope
(CONTACT-BRAND-SCOPE Q1). `brand_predicate` is the one place the rule is spelled. Core code:
it never imports the chatbot package (tests/chatbot/test_import_boundary.py).

ITEM-CLASS (PLAN-item-class-29oct.md D5, owner answers 29 Oct): `respond_contacts.brand_class_ids`
`{brand_id: [item_class_id, ...]}` narrows a brand in `brand_ids` to those classes; a brand with
no list keeps every class AND its products with no class, a brand with a list hides its products
with no class. The scope stays a frozenset of strings so every carrier (the session stamp, RQ
job args, turn ctx) passes it through untouched: a whole brand is its id, a class-narrowed brand
is one `<brand_id>/<item_class_id>` token per class (never the bare id). Only this module reads
the tokens (`_split_scope`).

`contact_id` is the INTERNAL `respond_contacts.id`; a Respond.io id resolves through
`field_access.resolve_contact_with_null_workspace_fallback` first (as
`contact_customer_scope.py` does).
