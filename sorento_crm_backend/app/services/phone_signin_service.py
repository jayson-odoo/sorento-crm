"""Phone sign-in (identity S1, #1280): AC-21 to AC-24, AC-26 to AC-28.

Normalises/masks a typed phone number, resolves it to an eligible user
without ever revealing whether the number belongs to anyone, dispatches the
WhatsApp code (reusing the portal's own OTP machinery), and builds the shared
login response - including ``home_path`` - both ``/auth/login`` and
``/auth/phone/verify`` return.

The router (``app/api/v1/auth.py``) stays HTTP-only: it owns the per-IP/per-
number Redis rate limiting (the same pattern every other unauthenticated
route in that file already uses) and shapes the response bodies; every DB
query and the OTP/session/Respond.io logic live here.
