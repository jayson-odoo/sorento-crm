"""Order inquiry derivation, the SCM handoff and the Excel (P10, AC-I1 to AC-I7).

The netting and the verb rule are the pure engine next door
(``project_order_inquiry_engine.py``). This file is everything around them: where the
covering pools come from, where the stock location comes from, how the rows are written
once and only once, how purchasing is handed them, and how they leave the system as the
spreadsheet the client already reads.

Five things worth knowing before changing anything here.

**The standard demand row is the confirmed Buy residual, and only that**
(`PLAN-scm-front-planning.md` section 4). `refresh_for_decision` is its ONLY writer and it
runs inside the atomic CS confirmation. Publish writes no inquiry and reconciliation writes
none (AC-D01), because a published order may be covered entirely by Reserve, Borrow or
timely SPO cover and ordering all of it would buy it twice. The netting engine below still
serves AMENDMENTS, whose exception verbs are a different thing from new demand.

**The inquiry is never a second source of demand** (AC-I6). Committed quantity lives on
`sales_order_lines` and the SCM reorder engine reads that, exactly as it does today.
These rows say what to DO about that quantity. The only thing they are read back for is
the coverage LEDGER below, which is a record of what a pool has already been promised
to, not a record of what anybody has ordered.

**The covering pool is consumed across publishes, not just within one.** Publishing a
second sales order against a project whose pre-order is already spoken for must not net
against the same 5,950 twice, so the pool is reduced by every row that already claims
it. ``covered_by`` is the key for that: the engine writes a stable label, not free text.
It stays NULL on a confirmed-Buy row: nothing covers it, because CS already removed the
covered part of the line.

**The stock location is never invented** (AC-H5). It is the warehouse on a CONFIRMED
allocation from slice P9. No confirmation yet means the column is empty, and the screen
and the spreadsheet both say so rather than defaulting to the master location.

**Purchasing is handed a task, not an email** (AC-I4). It is a `project_tasks` row on
the delivery phase, linked to the inquiry, plus an in-app notification. The rows stay in
`project_order_inquiry_rows` and the task points at them, so marking one actioned
updates the one record rather than a copy pasted into a description.

        `line_changes` (EMAIL-SO-CHANGES): per project line id a planning change is
        applying, the SO line's own `from_qty` / `to_qty` / `from_date` / `to_date` (the
        batch row's "What changed"), so the handover email says what the book did to a
        line whose buy this confirm reduces to nothing.

        The only creator of standard demand rows. Publish creates none and reconciliation
        creates none (AC-D01): a published-but-unconfirmed order may be covered entirely by
        Reserve, Borrow or timely SPO cover, and ordering all of it would buy it twice.

        What reaches purchasing is the confirmed Buy residual and nothing else - no netting
        pass, no coverage verbs, `covered_by` NULL. The evidence for why the rest of the
        line needs nothing bought belongs to the decision, not to a purchasing instruction.

        Three lifecycle rules, all of them AC-C07/AC-D05:

        * a still-unplaced row from a superseded revision is CANCELLED with the revision
          that replaced it named, never edited in place;
        * a row purchasing already actioned STAYS. Placed supply is in the ledger and this
          service does not get to rewrite history;
        * when the new need is lower than what was already placed, the difference becomes a
          `CANCEL_BALANCE` exception row stating both figures, so somebody answers it.

        Since partial confirmation (PLAN-fulfilment-planning-from-autocount-so.md 13.4) a
        revision covers the lines the planner chose. A line the previous revision covered
        and this confirmation did not name is CARRIED into the new revision by
        `ProjectSupplyService.confirm` and arrives here in `buy_lines` like any other, so
        its Buy stays on purchasing's list. `_retire_uncovered_rows` still cancels the
        still-raised rows of a line genuinely absent from the revision (one no longer on
        the order): that line is undecided again and its whole open quantity goes back to
        counting as demand, so a raised Buy row left behind would be the same requirement
        told to purchasing twice. Cancelled by the same rule and with the same words as
        any other superseded row - never deleted, because they are what purchasing was
        told.

        `borrow_shortfalls` is the fourth thing purchasing is handed, and the only one that
        is not about the borrowing line's own quantity: a borrow that pushed a DONOR
        location below zero availability opened a hole at THAT location, and it is raised
        there under its own verb (PLAN 13.11). A donor the borrow left covered raises
        nothing.

        `created` counts the rows this confirmation ADDED to purchasing's list. A carried
        line (`carried: True`) has its still-raised row moved under this revision - a
        cancel and a re-raise, so `confirmed_unplaced_buy_rows` keeps seeing it under the
        ACTIVE decision - but purchasing already had that row, so it is not counted.

        `settle_in_place_line_ids` names the lines a PLANNING CHANGE is applying (part 3,
        AC-P3-5), and on those the supersede-and-re-raise above is the wrong shape: the
        book moved the SAME instruction, so the row is UPDATED - same id, new quantity,
        new date, every link kept, the previous value on its note - and no second raised
        row is created for a line that already has one. `_settle_row_in_place` holds the
        rule, including the over-cover unlink (AC-P3-8) that replaces the CANCEL_BALANCE
        exception for a drop the row can simply absorb. Only where the line has exactly
        ONE still-owed row: where it has two, this build has no way to say which of them
        the book moved, and inventing an answer is worse than the supersede it already
        does.

        `uncover_reason_by_line` (S2/S3, `PLAN-board-reject-on-confirmed-line.md`, rework
        fix round): the bare per-line reason for a line `ProjectSupplyService.confirm`'s
        own `uncover_line_ids` dropped - passed straight through to `_retire_uncovered_
        rows`, so a withdrawn line's row reads "Taken out of the confirmation: <its own
        reason>" rather than the blanket "Superseded by revision N" every OTHER dropped

        told purchasing about, so what changed is the instruction's quantity and date -
        not which instruction it is. Cancelling and re-raising would have handed the row's
        links back with nothing said (a raised row carries none, but a linked one carries
        everything the buyer has already arranged) and left the line reading as two
        instructions on a screen whose whole point is one per line.

        Three things this writes and the supersede path does not:

        * the PREVIOUS value, in `previous_qty` / `previous_delivery_date` AND as prose on
          the row's own note ("Was 10 on 2026-08-25"). A DELAY that does not say what it
          was is not actionable, and the same is true of a quantity. The columns are what
          the Was / Now table reads; the note is for a person, and is never parsed back;
        * the OVER-COVER unlink (AC-P3-8): more linked than the new quantity gives the
          excess back, LATEST-dated document first, because the earliest arrival is the one
          the line still needs. No `CANCEL_BALANCE` exception is written for a drop the row
          absorbs in place - the exception exists for quantity already bought that this
          line no longer wants, and the unlink is exactly how it stops wanting it;
        * a need of nothing cancels the row outright, which is the honest end of a line the
          book reduced to zero.

        Returns False, changing nothing, when the line has no still-owed row or has more
        than one: with two the caller's supersede is the only answer that does not guess.
        It also declines a lone PLACED (or actioned) row that carries NO link, and that is
        the SO349754 WESERP10B shape: purchasing put 5 on a purchase order through a path
        that writes no link row, so there is nothing here to keep whole - restating the
        row at the new need would silently demote real placed supply back to raised and
        lose the netting that says 5 of it is already bought. The caller's own path nets
        `placed` off the need and raises only the difference, which is the right answer.

        instruction - two still-owed rows, a lone placed row with no link, or every row
        already actioned (excluded from its own `live` filter outright) - restated on
        EVERY buy row of the line instead (S2, `PLAN-board-oi-mechanical-22sep.md`,
        AC-B2-4..7). Purchasing sees the row(s) it already had, each carrying the new
        date, the old one on its own note and as `previous_delivery_date`, rather than
        the same rows left bare beside a duplicate ADVANCE/DELAY notice telling them the
        same thing a second time.

        Links and QUANTITIES are untouched, and that is what makes this safe to run
        regardless of what the quantity did (review round, 22 Sep): the two halves of a
        `DATE_AND_QTY_CHANGED` are independent, so gating the date stamp on the composed
        `need` matching the line's live buy total - as this used to - meant a book that
        moved the date AND the quantity moved neither on the existing row, left it
        sitting on the OLD date beside a freshly-raised remainder row on the new one,
        and suppressed the notice as well because a buy row existed. The quantity half
        stays the netting's own business: the caller falls through to it whenever `need`
        and the live buy total disagree.

        One handover line for the WHOLE line, not one per row (AC-B2-9): the line's
        `ADVANCE`/`DELAY` change is told once, off a single representative row, the same
        "one row per sales-order line" rule `_oi_demand_rows` already holds for the
        notice this replaces. `order_inquiry_changed_with_links` is per ROW, though, and
        fires for each stamped row that actually carries a link (review round): a date
        purchasing already bought against moving is exactly what that automation exists
        to tell them, and `_settle_row_in_place` fires it for the same reason.

        `will_net` is the caller's own fact (round 3, nit): whether the netting loop
        below this call in `_write` is about to run (`live_buy_qty != need`), which
        cancels every still-RAISED row of the line seconds after this method returns. A
        RAISED row is a live target here too - it still needs its date stamped, whether
        or not it survives what comes next - but it must never be the row the ONE
        handover line is recorded off: purchasing would be pointed at a row already
        gone by the time the email lands. When netting is coming, the representative
        is picked from whatever targets are NOT `raised`; falling back to the full list
        only when every target is (nothing else to point at).

        `refresh_link_state` is deliberately NOT called, unlike the settle path: nothing
        here changes a row's quantity or its links, so there is no coverage to re-derive
        - and it would DEMOTE the very shape AC-B2-6 is about, a lone `placed` row with
        no link row behind it, back to `raised` (the reason `_settle_row_in_place`
        declines that shape outright).

        Returns False, writing nothing, when there is no date to move to or every buy
        row already carries it - the caller reads that as "nothing to stamp" and falls
        through to its own fallback (AC-B2-4's fresh line has no row here to stamp at
        all).

        reads (`ProjectSupplyService.own_arrival_credit_for`) - reused rather than
        restated. Built off a MINIMAL `_LineFacts` (this call is a single-row question,
        not a walk) that carries no `required_date`, so this credit applies no
        reserve-window gate the way the board's own ladder does - a filed follow-up
        (plan), not a claim that the picker and the board agree on every case.

        AC-S3-14 (round-4 fix round): `_redirect_row_if_received` compares this credit
        against `linked_qty` (the row's LINKED total), not the row's own `qty` - the two
        diverge whenever a row's links do not sum to its own quantity. `need` is that
        caller-supplied number, required (round 5, S-2) - every caller already states
        what it is asking the credit to cover.

        `open_qty` is `qty_ordered - qty_delivered` (review round, SF1), the SAME reading
        of "open" every other `_LineFacts` builder in this codebase uses
        (`project_supply_service.py` `_facts_for` / `demand_facts`). A line ordered 40 and
        delivered 30 owes 10, so 10 is the most a credit may cover for it - reading the
        original 40 would settle a row in place off stock the line no longer needs.

        S2 (second review round): `self._own_arrival_left` is threaded through as the
        SAME per-instance ledger `own_arrival_credit_for` charges - without it, a replan
        settling several rows of one order in one call would re-read the same physical
        floor fresh for each row and could credit each of them off it in full. Rows are
        processed in the order the caller iterates them (date order).

        B2 (round 3): this is a per-ROW question, not a per-LINE one - two rows of the
        SAME line each carry their own, smaller need. Calling `own_arrival_credit_for`
        charged the ledger with the whole LINE's theoretical credit on the first row
        asked, so a second row of the same line read an already-drained ledger and was
        wrongly refused. Sized the same way `walk()` fixed this (S5): read the
        THEORETICAL credit with `_own_arrival_credit_components` (no charge, memoised per
        row id in `self._own_arrival_row_theoretical` - a SECOND call for the same row
        must judge against the SAME theoretical the first call sized, never a smaller one
        re-read off a ledger this row's own earlier charge already reduced), then charge
        only the DELTA beyond what this row was already charged.

        S-2 (round 5): the memo used to be on the ANSWER, keyed by row id, so a row asked
        first with a small `need` (an artificial probe, or an earlier caller with a
        smaller ask) froze that answer for every later call regardless of what `need` it
        was asked with - `_redirect_row_if_received`'s own `>= linked_qty` check could
        then read a stale, too-small credit and wrongly redirect a row landed stock
        covers in full. The memo is on the THEORETICAL credit and how much of it THIS row
        has been CHARGED so far (`self._own_arrival_row_charged`); each call answers
        `min(theoretical, need)` and charges only the wedge beyond the previous charge -
        never double-charging the ledger, never exceeding the theoretical, and a call
        with a larger `need` than before is answered in full rather than replaying the
        smaller one's cached number.

        its `qty`, `delivery_date`, `state` and the received link itself stand exactly as

        `_remove_links`, so the raise-time cascade below may draft it onto the fresh row
        this decline sends the caller to raise instead.

        line_ref` is the source of truth, and whenever the ESB book moves it, our own
        link on the affected row follows.

        `moves` is `DocumentIngestService.ref_moves` / `ShippingOrderIngestService.
        ref_moves` - `{"target_kind": "po"|"spo", "target_id", "old_ref", "new_ref"}`,
        one entry per PO line or SPO allocation whose ref genuinely changed on this
        push (the capture sites already drop a same-ref repush, AC-RL-45 second half;
        AC-RL-49 review fix: each service's own capture site now stages a move per
        record and only publishes it into `ref_moves` once that record's own
        savepoint has actually committed, so a move captured for a record that later
        fails is never read here at all). Called by `ingest.py`'s post-write hooks,
        after the ingest's own transaction has written the moved ref.

        `company_id` is the pushing principal's own anchor (AC-RL-48 security review
        fix): threaded down to `_resolve_ref_line` so a ref that happens to resolve
        to ANOTHER company's sales-order line is never read as confidently as one of
        ours. `actor_user_id` (SEC-N2) is threaded to `place_on_po_allocations`
        rather than the `None` it used to hard-code.

        AC-RL-50 security review fix: a single push can name arbitrarily many moves
        (a malformed or malicious ESB batch), and each one fans out into several
        queries (`_resolve_ref_line`, `_linkable_row_for_core_line`,
        `place_on_po_allocations`) - `FOLLOW_BOOK_REPAIRING_MAX_MOVES` caps how many
        of THIS call's `moves` are processed; the rest are skipped and logged.

        Returns how many moves the cap dropped (0 on every ordinary push) - the S4
        review fix (17 Sep): a dropped move used to be a log line only, invisible to
        the operator who pushed the batch. `ingest.py`'s hook reads this and folds it
        into the ingest response's own `summary`.

        trigger: str,
        company_id: str,
        actor_user_id: Optional[str] = None,

        """S1/S3 (`PLAN-oi-follow-book-chain.md`, AC-FB-1 to AC-FB-12, AC-FB-20,
        AC-FB-30 to AC-FB-33): a row follows the document AutoCount's own book
        already states for its sales-order line - closed or not, and even when
        another line's link is already sitting on it (owner ruling 18 Sep:
        "doesn't matter it is closed or not, if autocount has that linking, we
        must use and follow that"; D3, 19 Sep: "the book wins, always").

        Runs the OI sheet importer's own pairing rule
        (`project_order_inquiry_import_service.pair_needs`, an extraction of `_pair`
        with no behaviour change, AC-FB-12) against LIVE rows instead of a migrated
        one. `row_ids` is narrowed first to the cascade's own linkable predicate
        (`_linkable_row_for_core_line`'s: state, verb, ack) with need left
        (`_unlinked_need`), and resolved to each row's core sales-order line - a
        row whose mirror never adopted one is left alone, same as a row this pass
        does not otherwise touch.

        `company_id` pins the company scope for the WHOLE call (AC-FB-9), same
        shape and same reason as `ShippingOrderIngestService._apply`: the pairing's
        own queries are ordinary company-scoped ORM reads, filtered by whatever the
        session's ambient scope happens to be - and a caller whose own scope is
        wider than one company (an `X-API-Key` principal with no tenant resolved
        yet) must never resolve a ref belonging to another company as confidently
        as one of ours.

        D3 (AC-FB-30 to 33): when `pair_needs` cannot fully satisfy a need because
        a book-named target's whole capacity already sits under another core
        line's link, that link is DISPLACED - removed (or reduced, for the
        quantity the book row does not need) with a note, never a row of the SAME
        core line (AC-FB-6/33) - and `pair_needs` is re-run once so the freed
        capacity actually reaches the book row. The displaced rows are then
        offered to the ordinary cascade, once, after the book rows are linked.

        Each take is written through `_write_link` (the one link writer, exactly
        as the importer's own `apply` calls it) with `auto_trigger=trigger`, and
        `refresh_link_state` runs once for every row this call actually touched.

        `max_rows` is a CALLER decision, not a standing rule (fix round, 19 Sep):
        AC-FB-24's cap guards the external ingest surface, where one ESB batch
        can name arbitrarily many rows in a single request - the two ingest
        hooks pass `FOLLOW_BOOK_FOR_ROWS_MAX_ROWS` explicitly. The cascade
        caller (`auto_place_for_products`) and the backfill script pass
        nothing, so an ordinary company-wide Confirm/Link now/Auto link all
        press honours the book for every eligible row, not an arbitrary 200 of
        it (measured on the prod copy: capped at 200 of 4,588 rows named).
        `None` (the default) means uncapped. Returns how many rows this call
        dropped past `max_rows` - 0 whenever `max_rows` is `None` or nothing
        was dropped, whatever this call itself actually linked or displaced.

        Review round item 6 (both reviewers): the cap applies AFTER narrowing
        to linkable, book-named rows - never on the raw `row_ids` list, which
        could drop the one row the book actually names while keeping rows that
        were never going anywhere - and over a DETERMINISTIC order
        (`created_at`, `id`), so which row a tight cap admits does not depend
        on Postgres's own scan order.

        Review round item 7 (security S3 / reviewer blocker 8, AC-FB-55):
        `_may_reoffer` (private - no other caller sets it) caps the chain at
        one further book pass. A displaced holder is re-offered to the
        cascade, which runs ITS OWN book step for it (so a holder the book
        also names something for still gets to follow it - D3 does not stop
        because the row it is about happens to be a holder this call just
        displaced) - but if THAT pass displaces yet another holder, the row
        it displaces is re-offered WITHOUT a further book step: no third pass
        ever runs. Two real book passes, at most, per top-level call.

        taking it off whichever OTHER core line's link is sitting on it.

        Never a row of `protect_core_line_id` (AC-FB-6): the same line already
        holding its own document is not a conflict. Never a holder the book
        ALSO names this exact target for (AC-FB-33): two shipping-order lines,
        one per sales-order line, is each row on its own document, not a
        collision. A manual link is taken exactly like an automatic one
        (AC-FB-31, owner ruling 19 Sep). Partial: only what the book row needs
        comes off (AC-FB-30b) - the holder keeps the rest. Newest link first
        (review round item 5, `linked_at` desc, id tiebreak) - which holder
        loses the quantity is a stated rule, not Postgres's own scan order.

        `capacity` is the CALLER's own figure - the SAME `fact["capacity"]`
        `pair_needs` computed for this exact target (`_target_facts` +
        `_less_own_shipments`, review round item 4 / security B1): a purchase
        order line that has already shipped answers only for what has not
        sailed, and reading the raw `qty_ordered` here instead either strips a
        holder for a quantity the line can never actually give the book row,
        or, netted the other way, leaves a genuinely over-held target alone.

        AC-FB-55: sized in two passes, never one. FIRST, every existing link
        is classified - protected (this need's own core line, never touched),
        exempt (AC-FB-33) or displaceable - and `protected_qty` (what stays no
        matter what) sets the true ceiling: `capacity - protected_qty` is the
        most this target could EVER give a line other than the protected one,
        whatever gets stripped. The book row's actual gain is capped there
        (`max_gain`); if that is zero or less, NOTHING is displaced - a holder
        is never stripped for no gain. SECOND, exactly enough is taken off the
        displaceable holders (newest first) to make that gain reachable
        (`to_free`, which still accounts for a target already over-held: the
        over-holding excess comes off too, so the target never ends up over
        its own capacity again).

        `had_link` is the caller's own fact, not a fresh query: by the time a zeroed-out
        settle calls this, the row's links are already GONE - the very thing purchasing
        needs telling about - so re-deriving "does it have a link" here would always read
        False and the notification meant for exactly that case would never fire. A
        linkless amendment still queues nothing: CS changing an instruction nobody has
        bought anything against yet has nothing for purchasing to be warned moved.

        This runs deep inside the atomic confirm transaction, unlike the post-commit
        dispatches `complaints_service` and `form_skip_service` run AFTER their own

        above it, not just the innermost one - so the wrapping savepoint's own
        bookkeeping broke the instant a real dispatch ran. Queuing the CONTEXT now (while

        module-level `after_commit` listener, is the same pattern
        `product_spec_write.py`'s bypass backstop already uses for the same reason: real

        queued: `_record_handover` queues it, and "Send to purchasing"
        (`oi_handover_resend`) rebuilds an OI's open rows with it.

        Queued lines (`PLAN-scm-oi-handover-email.md` S0-S3) are fired post-commit by
        `_fire_pending_handover` - the same `Session.info` queue this file already uses
        for `_dispatch_changed_with_links` / `_notify_purchasing` above, and for the same
        reason: several call sites here run deep inside the atomic confirmation
        transaction, and `AutomationService` commits internally.

        `kind` is `"raised"` / `"settled"` / `"cancelled"` (PLAN 3.1's table); `was` is
        whatever of the row's PREVIOUS values actually differ from what it holds now -
        `None` for a plain raise, `{"qty": ...}` and/or `{"delivery_date": ...}` for a
        settle, `{"so_number": ..., "customer": ..., "project": ...}` for the one caller
        that already knows a CHANGE SO NO row's source order.

        Resolved and formatted EAGERLY, off THIS session, rather than re-read by the
        drain's fresh session: `_hand_to_purchasing` wraps its own work in
        `db.begin_nested()`, and a SAVEPOINT commit fires `Session`'s `after_commit` event
        exactly as a real outer commit does (confirmed against SQLAlchemy's own
        `SessionTransaction.commit()` - it dispatches whenever `self.nested` is true, not
        only at the root) - so the drain can run while the OUTER write is still open, and
        a fresh `SessionLocal()` genuinely cannot see it yet. `_dispatch_changed_with_links`
        above has the same constraint and answers it the same way: build the payload now,
        forward it later.

        `actor_user_id` falls back to the inquiry header's `raised_by` (AC-H18) when the
        write seam received none.

        `qty` (EMAIL-HANDOVER-QTY): what the line PRINTS as its quantity instead of
        `row.qty` - the line's new total, for a settled line told off a row whose own
        quantity never moved (see `_handover_settle_diff`). `None` reads the row.

        `borrow_hole`: whether the row is a Borrow's hole at its donor. `None` reads
        `_is_borrow_order_back`, which a cancel that already overwrote the note cannot.

        row can hold a manual link just as a confirmed one can hold only the cascade's
        own guess).

        `only_line_ids`/`reason` (owner case, 22 Sep 2026,
        `PLAN-board-reject-on-confirmed-line.md`, fix round): `ProjectSupplyService
        .uncover_lines`' whole-revision branch retires the very decision this call would
        otherwise diff against - there is no SUCCESSOR revision to name a
        `supply_decision_id != decision.id` row as belonging to an earlier one, so the
        ordinary query above would exclude every row this call means to retire (it found
        none, ever, for that branch - "one confirmed Buy line, reject it" left its raised
        row in front of purchasing for ever). Given explicitly, the query scopes to just
        these lines instead of diffing against a successor, reads `IV_ORDER_BACK` alongside
        `IV_ORDER`/`IV_CANCEL_BALANCE` (a Buy CS marked "Order back" with no `covered_by`
        document is not a step-3 placement - `retire_supply_borrow_rows` does not see it -
        but it is exactly as much this method's "line dropped, raised row must go" case as
        a plain ORDER row), and the note carries `reason` prefixed (B1/S4, review round 3):
        purchasing reads the same `note` column for a superseded-revision cancellation and
        for this one, and a bare reason fragment with no lead-in read as a glitch next to
        "Superseded by revision N" above it.

        `OrderInquiryRow.supply_decision_id == decision.id` (B1, review round 3): dropped
        from the first cut of this mode, which scoped by `so_line_id` alone. A row with NO
        `supply_decision_id` on the SAME line belongs to the amendment/book-change path
        (`derive_for_book_change` writes such a row onto the order's OWN header, verbs
        including `IV_ORDER`/`IV_CANCEL_BALANCE`, with no decision attached) - a different
        instruction to purchasing this method has never been the one to cancel, in the
        ordinary `else` branch below either. Without the predicate, rejecting a covered
        line whose header also carried a planning-change reaction cancelled that reaction
        alongside the decision's own row.

        `reason_by_line` (S2/S3, `PLAN-board-reject-on-confirmed-line.md`, rework fix
        round): the BARE reason CS gave for EACH withdrawn line, keyed by `so_line_id` -
        read in preference to `reason` (which on the reject path is the JOINED "Line N
        rejected: ...; Line M rejected: ..." sentence Confirm also stamps on the
        superseded revision's own `superseded_reason`). Without this a two-line
        withdrawal stamped every row with the WHOLE joined sentence, prefixed a second
        time by "Taken out of the confirmation: " - a row's own note is one line's
        reason, never every withdrawn line's. A row whose line is absent from the map
        falls back to `reason`/the ordinary default, unchanged.

        registered anything first.

        `get_transaction()` returns the session's ROOT transaction (SQLAlchemy's own
        contract), never an inner savepoint, so a nested savepoint opened and released
        inside the same request cannot smuggle a second row past the marker. There is

        project or not should also hand to purchasing").

        Best-effort on purpose. The rows this task points at are already written when
        this runs, so a notification backend that is down must not turn that success
        into a 500 the retry cannot repair. The write sits in a SAVEPOINT because this

        without one would leave that transaction aborted, and the caller's commit would
        then fail for an operation that had already succeeded (the post-commit
        side-effect lesson in CLAUDE.md, applied pre-commit).

        S1 (Opus review round 1, AC-OH-35): the ONE-TASK-PER-HEADER guard lives HERE,

        reacted minted a second `ProjectTask` and a second notification for one header.
        A caller that already holds a task for this inquiry gets nothing more.

        An order ADOPTED from the AutoCount book has `project_id` NULL by design, and

        runs for exactly them.

        `PLAN-scm-oi-handshake.md` section 3 (captain, 27 Aug 2026), reinstated as the
        page's own primary press by `PLAN-oi-confirm-per-so.md` S1/S2 (owner ruling 17 Sep
        2026), which retires G4's "born acknowledged, no manual confirm anywhere" reading.
        Two things happen in one press and they are one decision: the row becomes
        purchasing's work, and the documents that can cover it are tied to it if they were
        not already - most of them are, since raising and every other cascade door already
        run `include_awaiting=True` and never waited for this press (AC-CF-4). What Confirm
        adds is the handshake itself: the row leaves To confirm, is stamped with who and
        when, and only a confirmed SO's demand counts for reorder planning (S5).

        The guard stays TOLERANT of a row already acknowledged rather than refusing it: it
        is left exactly as it is - not re-stamped with a fresh time and name, because that
        would move the record of who actually confirmed it - and still joins the cascade
        below, so a repeated press (a double click, two tabs, "Select all N matching"
        catching a row somebody else just confirmed) is a no-op on the handshake and a real
        re-run of Link. Only a REJECTED row is refused: taking it back is CS re-deciding the
        line, not purchasing changing its mind about a row that no longer counts.

        The row's SUPPLY state is refused on too, but only when it is CANCELLED
        (PLAN-oi-cancelled-line-used-confirm.md, section 3.7, owner ruling 20 Sep 2026):
        a cancelled row was called off, so taking it on is taking on work nobody is
        doing. An ACTIONED row is different - it was answered somewhere else, but "seen"
        is still true of it (C2), and `_linkable_row_clauses` already keeps every
        non-linkable state, ACTIONED included, out of the cascade below, so confirming
        one takes the handshake stamp and links nothing.

        `link_up_to` is the LINK HORIZON the cascade half of the press runs under (section
        11): every named row is TAKEN ON whatever its date, and only the linking stops at
        the horizon, because the acknowledgement is the buyer reading the instruction and
        the link is the buyer answering it. `after_horizon` is what the banner reports as
        "N after <date>".

        Sep 2026) - the reverse of `acknowledge_rows`, for a row purchasing took on by
        mistake or a re-confirm CS has not actually made yet. It is reversible (Confirm
        again undoes it), so unlike every write above this refuses NOTHING: a row not
        currently `acknowledged`/`changed`, or CANCELLED regardless of what its
        `ack_state` still reads (a superseded row's handshake is history, not something
        to reopen) - already `awaiting`, `rejected`, or gone from this company's own
        scope entirely - is counted on `skipped` rather than raised as a 404 or a 422 for
        the whole batch. `row_ids` only, deliberately no `filter` branch: the Actions
        menu names exactly what is ticked, never "everything matching a scope" the way
        "Select all N matching" does for Confirm.

        Company-scoped the same way `acknowledge_rows`'s own `_rows_or_404` is: a bare
        `db.query(OrderInquiryRow)` naming the model at the TOP level of the statement,
        so the session's own `company_scope` listener (`with_loader_criteria`) silently
        excludes another company's row from `rows` below - it never reaches `found_by_id`
        and so counts as `skipped`, the same as a row_id nobody can find at all.

        Clears `ack_state`/`acknowledged_by`/`acknowledged_at` only. `changed_at` STAYS
        (owner ruling, review round 1): it is the Was/Now audit trail
        `_settle_row_in_place` reads and `_handshake_for_raise` carries forward across a
        carry, not a stamp of Unconfirm's own to clear.

        No cascade: taking a row off purchasing's plate does not touch whatever it was
        already linked to - only Unlink, by its own press, does that.

        `OrderInquiryRow` carries no `__audit_track__` (review round 1, security item d:
        verified by `test_oi_unconfirm.py::test_unacknowledge_writes_an_audit_log_entry`,
        which fails without this), so the generic session-dirty listener never sees this
        write - one `log_audit` call per BATCH, naming the actor and every row id this
        call actually moved, the same manual-event pattern `procurement_service.py` and
        `project_supply_undo_service.py` use for a write outside that listener's reach.
        Nothing is written when nothing was eligible - an audit entry for zero rows moved
        would be a log of NOT doing something.

    #
    # **A row keeps its full quantity and carries LINKS.** The captain, 25 August, walking
    # SO414285: "1 line here should correspond to 1 line in sales order, so 1 line can be
    # placed by multiple PO and SPO". `order_inquiry_rows` held exactly one `po_line_id`,
    # so a cascade needing two lines SPLIT the row - and nine sales-order lines read as
    # eleven instructions. `projects.order_inquiry_links` (migration 421) is one row per
    # placement; the row's `state` and `po_ref` are DERIVED from them, never written by
    # hand (`refresh_link_state`).
    #
    # **The lever on the reorder engine is netting, not a state test.** `committed_v`'s
    # confirmed leg counts `qty - sum(links.qty)` (migration 422), so a fully linked row
    # leaves confirmed demand exactly as `placed` did and a half-linked one leaves half.
    # Linking never makes the document SUPPLY - `on_order_v` still reads `spo_allocations`
    # alone - it retires the DEMAND that document is already covering.
    #
    # **Both PO lines and SPO allocations are candidates for every linkable row** (R5,
    # 27 August, widening the 25 August rule; `PLAN-scm-oi-worklist-excel-parity.md` S5).
    # An ORDER, a RESERVE & ORDER and an ORDER BACK row may all name either book -
    # `_SPO_LINKABLE_VERBS` equals `_LINKABLE_VERBS` below, not a narrower set.
    #
    # **Location ranks a candidate, it never filters one out** (Q5, ruled 25 August). Same
    # location, then the same ownership group at another site, then the site pools, then a
    # sibling location at the site. A link outside tier 1 is not a mistake - it is the
    # split instruction the buyer keys into AutoCount, and the PO occupancy panel marks it.
    #
    # **Then the PO's own date, then the line's** (Q7, ruled): `purchase_orders.issue_date`
    # ascending, then `expected_date`, then the document number. Before Q7 the key was the
    # line's expected date alone, which dealt a January line of an August purchase order
    # ahead of an August line of an April one.
    #
    # **A cited document comes before all of it.** CS naming "202604-S0083" on the form is
    # the most specific thing anybody knows about the row, and a walk that ignored it would
    # be answering a question nobody asked.

        `credit_own_links` asks the question a RE-DEAL has to ask: what could this row
        reach if it gave back what it is already holding? Its own links are added back to
        every line's `remaining`, so the walk compares the document it sits on against the
        alternatives on equal terms - without which a row fully covering itself would find
        its own line "fully claimed" and move to a worse one. Nothing is unlinked to ask
        it (B1, review round 28 Aug): the answer is computed FIRST and the links come down
        only once there is a better one to write, so a row whose candidate has gone, or
        that the horizon holds back, keeps what it has.

        `manual` widens it to a purchase order that is not yet ACTIVE. The automatic walk
        refuses one deliberately - a `draft_recommendation` order is not an outstanding
        order (it is outside `scm.on_order_v` for exactly that reason), and its lines are
        the ones a re-decision may delete out from under a link. A PERSON naming a line by
        hand has always been allowed to, because the dialog is override and audit rather
        than the workflow, and taking that away would have been a narrowing nobody asked
        for.

        ONE query pair feeding both the dialog's candidate list and the auto-link cascade,
        so the preview and the pass can never disagree. `remaining` is already net of every
        OTHER link on the same line, which is why two rows can never be pointed at the same
        quantity.

        SPO allocations are read for every linkable row (R5, 27 August - `spo_allowed`
        below reads `_SPO_LINKABLE_VERBS`, which equals `_LINKABLE_VERBS`, not an
        ORDER-BACK-only set). Their open test is the one
        copy in `app.services.scm.spo_supply` (`open_incoming_clauses`): open line status, a
        receipt status that is not received, no landed shipment - and, per the captain's
        26 August ruling, a promised date in the PAST does not remove a row. The book is
        the record of what is still owed; a supplier being late is not evidence the goods
        stopped existing.

        LADDER V4 (section 1d): a purchase-order line sitting at a `*-<group>` location is
        free only to the extent the GROUP can cover its own backlog with it -
        `group_net + the group's own open PO balance > 0`. In deficit those lines are
        already spoken for, and linking a raised row to one of them says a quantity is
        covered when the group is 15,514 short of covering what it already owes. A
        pool-location line has no group and is always offered; the row that finds nothing
        stays raised and buys, which is the honest outcome.

        DEDICATION (G7, `PLAN-scm-reorder-oi-feedback-1sep.md` S6): `scm.order_link_claim`
        - explicit claims only, never a location or product match - subtracts every OTHER
        SO's live outstanding from a line's `remaining`, in the same order regardless of
        which claim is walked first (a straight sum, clamped at zero the same way a
        SO-date-ordered cascade against the line's own capacity would be). This row's OWN
        claim reserves nothing against itself, and a line it claims ranks first among the
        candidates (`_candidate`'s sort key). Never removed from the list on account of
        dedication alone - a fully dedicated line still shows, greyed, so the buyer sees
        why and can still name it by hand (AC-6.5); the OLD `remaining <= 0` exclusion
        below fires only for a line already spoken for by an actual link, unchanged.

        PROJECT-BIN LOCK (G12, same slice): a line at a `segment = 'project'` warehouse is
        `cascadable` ONLY when this row's own claim names it - claimed by another SO or
        claimed by nobody are refused alike. Never a `remaining` cut: an unclaimed bin's
        whole quantity is still there for a manual link to take, which is what converts it
        to claimed (AC-6.9). A pool-destination line carries no such lock (AC-6.10).

        The claim the lock waits for comes from ONE of three places, and never from this
        walk (captain, 2 Sep 2026, on real data - see `_candidate`'s `cascadable`):

          * the book's own `FromSODocList` column, on either purchase channel
            (`po_history` / `po_upload` claims);
          * the SUPPLY WRITER that created the line, at the moment it created it
            (`app/services/scm/supply_claim.py`, `crm_supply` claims) - a purchase order
            this codebase raised off the plan is a buy for the order-inquiry rows that
            sized it, and it says so in the same transaction that opens the line;
          * a person naming the line by hand in the Link dialog (`manual`, AC-6.9).

        A line none of the three attributed is UNATTRIBUTED and stays manual-link only.
        A blank `FromSODocList` beside a Loading Date remark such as "REPLACE BACK" means
        the line belongs to somebody else's order (captain, 2 Sep), which is one more
        reason the automatic pass may not help itself to one.

        pool (it does not - a group line is a group line precisely because it is not one)
        or when THIS row's own SO already claims it (`own_so_claim`, G12's `own_claim`).
        This set therefore bears on the automatic pass only through that second, narrower
        door; its main effect is still on what `_candidates_for_row` OFFERS, which is what
        the Link dialog lists and what a manual placement (`manual=True`) may take. Left in
        place rather than removed for that reason.

        `group_net + everything still to come on the group's own purchase orders`. At or
        above zero the group has purchases nobody has claimed and a row may link to one;
        BELOW zero, every unit already on order is owed to demand the group carries and a
        link would promise the same stock twice.

        ZERO IS OFFERED, and that boundary is the ordinary case rather than an edge one
        (captain, 27 Aug). A purchase order raised off the plan buys exactly what the plan
        said the group was short, so the group lands on precisely `net + remaining == 0`.
        Read as "at or below zero is deficit", that group was refused its own purchase
        order: the rows that sized the buy stayed raised, the PO-confirm cascade offered
        them nothing and the Link dialog listed nothing. Nothing is promised twice at zero -
        the demand the buy covers IS the demand the group carries.

        The second half of the same ruling - a group holding an ACKNOWLEDGED, UNLINKED row
        for this product may reach its own purchase order however short the arithmetic says
        it is - is NOT applied here. It is a per-ROW exemption and it is applied by
        `_candidates_for_row` to the row being placed (B1, code review 27 Aug 2026):
        lifting the group out of this set instead exempted EVERY row of the product, so a
        row at another group entirely - walked first, because candidates are ranked by
        location and never filtered by it - helped itself to the line the exempt group's
        own backlog had been bought.

        The deficit itself is computed off the CANDIDATE ROWS, so it costs no query beyond
        the netting read: those rows already are the product's whole open purchase-order
        book, and `by_po` is already netted for the links written against them. That claim
        was FALSE while the exemption lived here - it ran up to three uncached queries per
        row through `_groups_awaiting_a_link` (S3, code review 27 Aug 2026) - and is true
        again now the exemption is the caller's, and memoised per product besides.

        candidate in the order it was given, until the need is covered - or NOTHING at all,
        ruled by the owner 8 Sep 2026 (slice D): when the cascadable candidates cannot
        cover `need` IN FULL, this returns an empty list rather than the partial cover it
        used to.

        Half covering a 493-piece row and buying the other 378 strands whatever the half
        DID cover - it cannot be re-offered to another row that needed exactly that much -
        while leaving the row PARTLY LINKED with the balance still counting as demand. The
        row's whole quantity going to Buy is the honest outcome when nothing on hand can
        answer it in full; a row already `partly_linked` from before this ruling is left
        exactly as it is (not retro-applied), and `partly_linked` stays reachable through a
        re-deal, a book re-upload, or a manual partial taken by hand in the Link dialog -
        none of which calls this method (`place_on_po_allocations` walks `by_target`
        directly and is never routed through the cascade).

        `held_by_others` (AC-LT-14, G2) is the walk's own suggestion-path addition: what
        OTHER rows already suggested on each target, this pass or an earlier one. The
        ALL-OR-NOTHING gate above stays read off the document's raw capacity - a line
        that can genuinely cover the need is never refused outright over a scarcity
        another row's own GUESS created - but the per-candidate take below is netted
        against it, so two rows are never offered the very same units. `None` (every
        caller before this parameter existed, and the Link dialog's own preview) is a
        no-op and leaves this exactly as it always was.

        Review round 4 found that netting `held_by_others` UNCONDITIONALLY double-
        subtracted a claim-dedicated candidate's share: `remaining` is already reduced by
        `_reserved_for_netting` for every OTHER sales order's claim on the line, so
        subtracting that same other claimant's suggestion again on top read two rows
        each claim-dedicated 30 and 84 of one 114 line as 84 and 0 instead of 30 and 84.
        Round 4's fix over-corrected: exempting every `own_so_claim`/`cited` candidate
        from `held_by_others` outright let two rows CITING the same document take its
        full capacity twice (`test_ac_lt_14_two_cited_rows_still_net_against_each_
        other`), and let two rows of the SAME sales order - `_reserved_for_netting`
        skips a row's OWN SO, so neither row's `remaining` was reduced for the other -
        each take the line's full amount
        (`test_ac_lt_14_two_rows_of_one_so_never_suggested_more_than_the_line`).

        Review round 5: only the SLICE of `held_by_others` that `_reserved_for_netting`
        already reserved for another SO's claim is exempt, never the whole thing, and
        never on the say-so of `cited` alone (a citation is not a claim). That slice is
        `raw_remaining - remaining` - exactly what `_reserved_for_netting` subtracted
        when this candidate's `remaining` was built - so a held total that MATCHES it
        (the two-claimants case: the other claimant's own suggestion is exactly its
        reserved share) nets to zero here, same as before, while any held total ABOVE it
        (a cited or same-SO row's actual take, which is not backed by a reservation this
        candidate's own `remaining` already accounts for) still nets in full.

        Every RAISED, placeable row of the named products - or of every product with one,
        when `product_ids` is omitted - is cascaded against its own open PO lines,
        HIGHEST FULFILMENT PRIORITY FIRST. AC-H5 says the ranking that decides ANY
        draw-down is the SAME policy, everywhere it applies - so which row claims a
        scarce PO line first is scored through `scm.priority.factors_for_demand_rows`,
        the identical assembly the fulfilment board and the Loading Plan already use,
        rather than a private sort this method grew on its own. That answers the
        captain's 20 Aug question - "do we account for both SO date and delivery date?"
      - with both: `need_by_date` from the row's own `delivery_date`, and
        `document_age` from the sales order's own document date (`published_at`, or
        `created_at` before publish - see `_rank_raised_rows`). With no active
        `PriorityPolicy` the call falls back to `DEFAULT_WEIGHTS` on its own; ties
        (including "this policy weights nothing here") fall back to the original
        ordering (`delivery_date` then `created_at`), so this is a strict refinement of
        the old behaviour, never a different one. A second run places nothing further: a
        row this pass placed (or split) is no longer `raised`, so it drops out of the
        very query that feeds the next run - the idempotence the three triggers all rely
        on. The doors are ACKNOWLEDGE, Link now, a purchase-order confirm and - since
        `PLAN-scm-oi-draft-links.md` R6 - the board's own confirm again. What the board's
        pass writes is a DRAFT, because its rows are `awaiting`, which is why it is safe:
        purchasing still says the word, and now they say it looking at an answer.

        `trigger` is stamped onto every placement it makes (`_apply_placement`'s
        `auto_trigger`), so "why is this placed" is always answerable from the row's own
        note - never a silent placement with nothing to show for it.

        `link_up_to` is the LINK HORIZON (section 11, captain 27 Aug): a row due AFTER it is
        left Not linked and counted on `after_horizon` rather than skipped silently, so a
        2030 order stops eating a purchase order a nearer one needed. Omitted, it is the
        reorder plan's own horizon (`resolve_link_horizon`) - a press that says nothing is
        a press under the horizon the plan planned to. A caller that genuinely wants NO
        horizon says so, with `link_horizon="none"` (S1).

        `include_awaiting` and `redeal_drafts` are the DRAFT half
        (`PLAN-scm-oi-draft-links.md` R1/R2/R6). A link on a row purchasing has not
        confirmed is a draft, so:

        * `include_awaiting` widens the gate below to awaiting rows, which is what lets the
          board's own confirm - and a purchase-order confirm, and Auto link all - find the
          documents up front rather than leaving the page blank until somebody presses
          Confirm. The links it writes read as drafts because their rows are awaiting;
        * `redeal_drafts` lets a draft MOVE, so a nearer document that has arrived since can
          take over. Only drafts: a confirmed row's link is a promise, and no automatic pass
          ever moves it (R2). The take is computed first and the old links come down only
          when there is a better answer to write in their place, so a row the horizon holds
          back, a row whose document has closed, and a row the walk lands on the same
          document again all come out of the pass exactly as they went in (B1/S4).

        Both default to false, so Confirm's own cascade and every existing caller keep the
        acknowledged-only gate they were written under.

        `inquiry_id` (S3, `PLAN-oi-header-list-detail.md`) scopes the WHOLE pass to one
        header's own rows, on top of `row_ids` / `product_ids` when either is also
        given - the OI detail page's gear > Auto link, which must never touch a row of
        another header even when it shares a product with this one.

        claims a scarce PO line first is decided by the one active `PriorityPolicy`,

            ranking input was never touched by
            `PLAN-oi-handover-so-date-autocount-25sep.md`: `_context_for` and the
            handover email now prefer the core `sales_orders.order_date` for the

            sales_orders.order_date` for the score a row is RANKED by - the two have
            drifted apart, and pointing this cascade's `order_date` at the same core
            column is a named follow-up, out of scope for that lane.
          * `demand_class`       <- always `"project"`: every row this cascade sees came
            off a project order inquiry.
          * `payment_terms_days` <- the resolved customer's terms
            (`_customer_ids_for_pso` + `priority.payment_terms_by_customer`) when a
            customer is reachable, `None` otherwise - an unknown is ABSENT, not a
            default.

        `factors_for_demand_rows` resolves the active policy itself (falling back to
        `DEFAULT_WEIGHTS` when none is active), so nothing here hand-rolls a fallback.
        Rows tie on their score - including "this policy weights nothing here" - break
        to the ORIGINAL ordering, `delivery_date` then `created_at`: this is a strict
        refinement of what the cascade did before, not a different rule.

        2026): `factors_for_demand_rows`'s own docstring is explicit that it normalizes
        VALUES ACROSS THE ROWS PASSED IN - "the caller passes one cell's contributors,
        not the world" - because a rank only means anything against the rows actually
        competing for the SAME scarce PO lines. `auto_place_for_products` calls this
        with every raised row across EVERY product in one batch; passing the whole batch
        through in one `factors_for_demand_rows` call let an unrelated product's extreme
        `order_date` compress the `document_age` axis for every OTHER product's rows too,
        which could flip which of two genuinely competing rows on the SAME product wins
        the only PO line there is. Grouped by product here instead, each group scored in
        isolation, then the ranked groups concatenated back in the order their product
        first appeared in `rows` - so which PRODUCT is processed first is unchanged, only
        the SCORE within a product no longer depends on demand for a different one.

        Section 3.G, AC-G3. The occupancy panel exists to show the buyer that a PO line says
        DC1 while the demand is at BRW-BB; acting on that finding means re-keying the split
        in AutoCount and uploading the book again. The book then states BRW-BB 487 + BRW 13,
        and the placements are still sitting on the line that used to be DC1 - so the finding
        the buyer just acted on is still on the screen, and the split reads as if it never
        happened. This is the step that finishes the loop: "keeps every placement attached to
        the line whose warehouse matches; none is orphaned or unplaced".

        Deliberately narrow, in four ways, because a book upload runs over thousands of
        documents and a relocation nobody asked for is worse than no relocation at all:

        * **within ONE purchase order.** A link already names this document; moving it
          between two of the document's own lines re-reads what the buyer restated. Moving it
          to a DIFFERENT document would be buying decision, and that is Link PO's job.
        * **exact location only.** The target line's warehouse must be the row's own
          `stock_location`, not a tier-2 group sibling or a pool. Anything looser would move a
          placement to a line that reads "location differs" just the same, for no gain.
        * **never off a line that already fits.** A row sitting at tier 1 is left exactly
          where it is, or every upload would churn the link audit for nothing.
        * **whole links, never split ones.** A target with less room than the placement needs
          is passed over: half a placement on a line the book has closed is the very state
          this is fixing.

        Capacity is `qty_ordered` less what OTHER links already claim, not `outstanding`. The
        history channel writes its lines closed and fully received, and this is a relocation
        rather than a promise of fresh supply - the quantity was always against this document.
        Open lines are preferred over closed ones, then the earliest expected date.

        Answers how many links moved. Idempotent: a second run finds every placement already
        at tier 1 and moves nothing.

        at any savepoint release - see that listener's own docstring for why).

        `after_commit` fires on EVERY `SessionTransaction.commit()`, nested or not
        (`self._parent is None or self.nested`, straight from SQLAlchemy's own source),

        Skips the append entirely when nothing is pending on this session (AC-H24): every
        OTHER commit anywhere in the app also fires this listener (`after_commit` is a
        `Session`-wide event, not scoped to order-inquiry work), and a long-running import

        Not `after_commit`: see `_mark_handover_transaction_committed` above for why a
        plain commit event cannot by itself tell "a savepoint just released, more of
        this write may follow" from "the write itself just landed". `after_transaction_end`
        gives the CONCLUDED transaction directly (fired from `SessionTransaction.close()`,
        by which point `session._transaction` has already moved to its parent).

        Review round 2 ruling (AC-H27/AC-H28): `planning_change_service.apply` gives
        EACH ORDER its own savepoint, so matching on "the transaction active when the
        line was recorded" (round 1's fix) fired once PER SAVEPOINT - one email per
        order instead of R2's one email per WRITE, and could dispatch for rows a later
        PARENT rollback still had a chance to remove. So this drains ONLY when
        `transaction` is the ROOT (`transaction.parent is None`) - every line recorded
        under any savepoint of this write (`_record_handover` tags each with the
        OUTERMOST entry of its own `_transaction_chain`, not the innermost) waits for
        THAT SAME root object to conclude, however many savepoints came and went above
        it. A savepoint release itself does nothing here at all - the queue is simply
        left as it is, still pending, until the root concludes. An inner savepoint's own
        ROLLBACK is untouched by this listener (its `transaction.parent is not None`
        guard below returns immediately) - `after_soft_rollback`'s C2 tx_chain rule
        further down discards exactly that savepoint's own lines, independently.

        `after_transaction_end` ALSO fires for a ROLLED-BACK transaction (`close()` runs
        on both paths) and, per `SessionTransaction.rollback()`'s own source, runs BEFORE
        `after_soft_rollback` dispatches - so without the commit check below, a root
        rollback would drain and dispatch its own items instead of the discard further
        down ever getting a chance to (AC-H10, AC-H28). `_HANDOVER_COMMITTED_TX_KEY` is
        what that check reads.

        `transaction`'s OWN marker (if it has one) is pruned FIRST, unconditionally, on
        every exit path below (AC-H24) - a transaction ends exactly once, so its marker
        is dead weight the moment this fires, whether or not anything was pending for it.
