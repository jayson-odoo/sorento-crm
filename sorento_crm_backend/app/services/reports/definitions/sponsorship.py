"""Report #1: the sponsorship register, the workbook the project-sales team keeps by hand.

The whole report is this file plus its dataset. There is no route, no schema, no frontend
page and no Excel code specific to it - which is the claim the foundation was built to make
(PLAN-reporting-foundation, "Why a foundation and not a page").

The defaults are the workbook's own shape, decided with the user on 2026-08-26:

- month bucket = `approved_at`, and the basis is a filter, because a form approved in July
  for a June enquiry belongs in July's takings;
- statuses = approved + processed by CS, because a draft is not a sponsorship;
- eight detail columns, the OTHERS column dropped (empty in all twelve 2025 sheets);
- the summary is salesman by month on both money columns, which is the pivot the team
  reads first.
