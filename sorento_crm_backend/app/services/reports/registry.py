"""What a report IS: a dataset, a few params, two layouts and a workbook spec.

The foundation's whole claim is that report #2 costs one dataset plus one definition and
a two-line route wrapper. So everything a report varies is declared here as data, and
nothing about any particular report lives in the engine, the renderer or the routes.

Deliberately small (PRINCIPLES.md, "simplest thing that works"):

- **Two layouts.** Detail (a flat table) and Pivot (row dim x col dim x measures). The
  workbook is 12 identical detail tables plus one pivot, and every operational report the
  client has asked for decomposes the same way.
- **Three param types.** Date basis, period, select. A fourth is added when a report needs
  one, not before.
- **One derived column shape.** ``TickGroup`` - a dimension rendered as one tick column per
  value present, under a merged header. That is the workbook's "EXPECTED YEAR OF DELIVERY".

An expression is a function of the query context, because the interesting ones depend on
which date basis the user picked (the month bucket is ``date_trunc(<basis>)``). A date
basis is a plain column - it cannot depend on itself.
