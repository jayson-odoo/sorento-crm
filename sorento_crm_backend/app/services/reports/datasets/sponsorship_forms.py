"""The rows behind the sponsorship report: `purchase_requests` of type sponsorship_form.

**Company scope is deliberately `none`, and this is where that is justified.**
`purchase_requests` carries no `company_id` at all, and 0 of 48 live forms link to a
project - so scoping through the linked project, the way `sponsorship_link_service` does,
would blank the whole report for everybody. A sponsorship form belongs to whoever raised
it, not to a company, until the day the table gains a company of its own. Declared, not
defaulted (registry.Dataset refuses a dataset that says nothing about scope).

Everything the workbook shows is read here as SQL, so the detail table and the pivot are
two shapes of ONE row set and cannot disagree:

- `sales_agent` resolves LIVE from the requestor contact (same precedence as
  `PurchaseRequestHeader.requested_by_contact_name`) and falls back to the typed
  `requested_by`. A renamed contact regroups history; that is the accepted trade, and it
  is the same rule the rest of the app already shows.
- `project_title` prefers the LINKED project's title over the typed one.
- `sample_price` is the form's own lines added up, `COALESCE(total, quantity * unit_price)`,
  exactly as the form's footer computes it. A form with no lines has no sample price: NULL,
  which the engine renders as absent and the workbook prints as "-". Never 0.00.
- `project_value` is the numeric column only. The "BULK ORDER EST RM1.6MIL" style of answer
  lives in `project_value_text` and stays OUT of every total.

The three tables besides `purchase_requests` are reached as CORE tables rather than mapped
entities on purpose. `projects.projects` is company-scoped, and the ORM's `do_orm_execute`
listener would splice that scope into any statement mentioning the mapped class - which is
precisely the blanking this dataset exists to avoid.
