"""The rows behind the Chat overview: one row per customer ask the chatbot answered
(`chatbot.chat_ask_facts`, chat analytics CA-1).

**Company scope is deliberately `none`, and this is where that is justified.** One bot
serves every company, and an ask carries no company of its own: `company_id` on a fact is a
snapshot of the asking contact's primary customer link, so an unlinked contact (a stranger
who wrote in) has none at all. Scoping through it would blank exactly the asks the owner most
wants to see. The report is staff-only behind `chatbot.analytics.view`, granted to whoever
may already read the chat history. CA-3 adds the company-scoped dealer and salesman views,
which is where a per-company arm earns its place. Declared, not defaulted (registry.Dataset
refuses a dataset that says nothing about scope).

**Nothing here can show what a customer wrote.** The fact table has no message, summary,
phone or contact name to select, and the catalog adds none: `customer` is the linked
ACCOUNT's name from `customers`, a business, not a person. No UUID is a column either.

**Codes are shown as words, in the dataset.** Outcome, contact type, audience, failure reason and branch
are CASE expressions that map the stored code to its plain words (the same device as
`sponsorship_forms._STATUS_LABEL`), so the pivot's row labels and the detail table read the
same and no code reaches the screen. The filters (`outcome`, `contact_type`) compare the raw
columns, never the words. A pivot row dimension prints only the values present, which is why
this is not `fixed_values`: that would print an empty row for every outcome, noise included,
and would still leave the detail table in codes. The rows therefore sort alphabetically by
their words. The branch words are a local copy of the trace screen's lane words: the report
may not import the chatbot package.

**Weeks and months are Malaysia's.** `ctx.date_basis` is already the Malaysia wall clock
(engine `resolve`), so `date_trunc('week', ...)` buckets a Sunday 17:00 UTC ask into the
Monday it is in Kuala Lumpur, and the period predicate, the bucket and the printed date
cannot disagree. Weeks run Monday to Sunday (Postgres' own).

**`failed` is `failure_reason IS NOT NULL`.** The writer sets a failure reason for exactly the
failed outcomes (technical, cannot_do, missed), so the report needs no copy of that list that
could drift from `chatbot/analytics/outcome.py` (and the chatbot package may not be imported
from here).

`customers` is reached as a CORE table, not a mapped entity: it is company-scoped, and the
ORM scope listener would splice that scope into any statement mentioning the mapped class,
blanking the name for a session with no company set.
