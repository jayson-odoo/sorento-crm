"""Chatbot stock ask v2 (PLAN-chatbot-stock-ask-v2-24sep.md): what happens after a stock ask
is answered.

S4 (R8): when the asking contact's "Notify salesman" is on, the customer's sales agent gets
one WhatsApp message per answered product for `too_big`, `in_stock` and `no_incoming` (never
`incoming`, R6 B3). The chain is dealer contact -> customer (`resolve_customer`) ->
`customers.sales_agent_id` -> `sales_agents.contact_id` -> that contact's `respond_io_id`. A
missing link is a skip with its reason and a warning, never a raise. The send goes through
`send_text_or_template` (the `stock_ask_salesman` template outside the 24-hour window, the
same wording as plain text inside it) and every attempt writes one `integration_log` row.

Core, not the chatbot package: the engine calls in here once the turn row is closed, and the
RQ job (`app/tasks/stock_ask_tasks.py`) runs the send. Nothing here imports
`app.services.chatbot` (`tests/chatbot/test_import_boundary.py`).
