"""Mapping a published Project SO onto the AutoCount sales order it became (Stage 1B).

Contract: `documentation/plans/scm/STAGE1B-scm-front-planning-reconciliation.md` sections 2
to 4, `PLAN-scm-front-planning.md` sections 3.1 and 4, UAC AC-A01 to AC-A04.

The header half already exists: `ProjectSOIngestService.reconcile_core_order` adopts the
AutoCount number and points `projects.sales_orders.so_id` at the core row. This file adds
the LINE half - which core `sales_order_lines` row each Project line became - and the one
whole-SO review state that follows from it.

## The mapping rule, and why it is two passes

Candidates are the core lines of `so_id` that are not closed AND are not already held by
another Project SO's line. A Project line whose existing `core_sales_order_line_id` still
names one of them KEEPS it, on candidacy alone: reconciliation runs again every time somebody
presses Re-run, and a mapping that reshuffles itself under a person who has already read it is
worse than one that occasionally reports an exception.

The rest are matched inside each `product_id` group, in the same two passes
`app/services/scm/outstanding_diff.py` uses to identify a line across weekly uploads:

1. **exact required-date match**, and ONLY when exactly one Project line and one core line
   share that date. Two of either is a genuine "which of these is which", so both sides are
   reported ambiguous and NOTHING is written - a guess here links a customer's quantity to
   the wrong delivery date.
2. **whatever is left pairs in date order**, both sides sorted by date and zipped. That is
   the rule a person can check by eye: "you had lines due 1 Jul and 3 Aug, the document has
   15 Jul and 3 Aug, so the 1 Jul line moved."

Leftover Project lines are `missing`, or `duplicate` when the core line for that item is held
by another Project SO (two sales orders adopted the same AutoCount document, and one of them is
wrong - `uq_projects_so_line_core_line` allows exactly one holder, so reporting this is the
only alternative to dying on the index). Leftover core lines are `surplus` (the document has a
line this sales order does not, which is answered in AutoCount Differences).

## What this file must never do (AC-A04)

Reconciling writes core-line links and nothing else. It creates no purchase requirement and
no order inquiry row: purchasing demand is created inside the atomic SO confirmation, from
the confirmed Buy residual alone (`ProjectOrderInquiryService.refresh_for_decision`, the
only writer of a standard demand row). What reconciling DOES do to a confirmed order is
retire its decision - a re-mapped line supersedes the active revision and drifted facts
challenge it (AC-C06) - so the SO returns to Needs CS review rather than staying confirmed
against a mapping that has moved.

## No UUID in a message

Every exception names a Project line number and an item code, or an item code alone for a
surplus core line, and the `message` carries the REASON only - the screen prints the subject
itself ("Line 2, SRT501-CP"), so a message repeating it renders the same fact twice.

        A UNION of two arms, disjoint by construction:

        * arm 1, `row_kind = 'sales_order'` - an OUTSTANDING project-class core sales
          order, whether or not anybody has planned it. This is the arm that makes the
          AutoCount book visible without a row being written for it (AC-FP01): an
          unplanned order reads `not_started` and carries no planning record's fields,
          because no planning record exists to carry them.
        * arm 2, `row_kind = 'planning_record'` - a planning record this system authored
          that arm 1 does NOT already carry. Stage 1B's Awaiting reconciliation.

        The plan words arm 2 as "planning records with `so_id IS NULL`". That is the same
        set for every order the plan describes, and it loses one the plan does not: a
        published order LINKED to a core sales order that is not project-class, or whose
        lines are all covered, is on neither arm and would silently vanish from the screen
        Stage 1B built it for. So the rule implemented here is "not already represented by
        arm 1", which is a superset of both and keeps each subject on exactly one row
        (AC-FP03). Deviation recorded in the plan's section 6.

        Ordering is earliest OUTSTANDING required date ascending, undated last, tie-broken
        on the human key - the sales-order number, else the AutoCount document number, else
        our own reference (AC-FP04). Total, so no row lands on two pages or on neither, and
        it is the order the work is actually due in rather than the order somebody last
        saved a record in.

        Paging is done in Python, and this is a deliberate change from Stage 1B's SQL
        paging. Two arms over two tables have no single SQL cursor to offset, and the
        population is bounded by what is outstanding: 605 core orders and 16 planning
        records on the live book (plan section 12). The alternative is a hand-built UNION
        over `__table__`, which would leave the company predicate to be spliced in by hand
        on both arms - fail-open exactly where AC-FP06 must be fail-closed.

        The review state is DERIVED and has no column, so it is derived for as few subjects
        as the filter allows: not at all for `not_started` (which is simply "no planning
        record"), for every planning record when another state is filtered on, and for the
        page alone when nothing is filtered.
