"""The quotation's side of the product picture: live while it is a draft, frozen at issue.

`product_image_service` owns the DECISION (which photograph is the product). This module owns
WHEN a quotation stops asking. Those are different questions and they resolve at different
moments:

- **A draft asks every time it is read.** Only 30 of the 535 products with candidate photos carry
  a choice, so almost every line is priced before anybody has answered for its product. Stamping
  the answer onto the line at save time would mean the choice made ten minutes later never
  reaches the quotation, and nobody is going to re-save 52 lines to collect it.
- **Issuing writes it down.** `project_quotation_lines.image_attachment_id` is the record of the
  photograph the customer was sent. Once stamped it is never overwritten - not by a later
  revision, not by the product's photo being re-chosen - because a re-download of R1 next year has
  to be R1.

The freeze is therefore a FILL, never an update: `image_attachment_id IS NULL` is the only row it
touches. That is what makes it safe to run again on the same version when an unchanged scope is
carried into R2, and it is why R1 and R2 of that scope cannot disagree about a picture.

The technical drawing (QUOTATION-UX) follows the same two rules in `drawing_attachment_id`: a
draft shows the product's first "Technical Specifications" image live, and issuing fills it. Both
columns can also be PICKED in the editor when a product has several (the pick is validated by
`project_quotation_service.assert_line_picks`), and a pick is simply a value the freeze will not
overwrite.
