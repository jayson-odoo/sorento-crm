"""Saved decisions on the planning board (S4 of `PLAN-scm-fulfilment-feedback-2sep.md`).

One row per CORE SALES ORDER LINE, in `projects.so_supply_decision_drafts` - addressed from
outside by the board's contribution key, and identified inside by the line that key resolves
to (C2, code review round 4: none of the key's own four parts survives a re-upload that
renumbers the order, a partly-mirrored order, or a change of granularity). Three readers and
they are deliberately the only three:

  * the two routes, `PUT` / `DELETE .../fulfilment-planning/lines/{key}/draft`;
  * `FulfilmentBoardService.build`, which stamps what is saved back onto the board;
  * `ProjectSupplyService._write_decision`, which deletes the drafts a confirmation
    promotes, inside the confirmation's own transaction.

The draft's decision is OPAQUE here. The confirmation is posted from the board's own body
(`confirmLinesFor` composes every line it sends, whether from the saved decision or from the
engine's suggestion), so nothing on the server reads inside this JSON - it is stored, handed
back, and deleted when the line it belongs to is confirmed.
