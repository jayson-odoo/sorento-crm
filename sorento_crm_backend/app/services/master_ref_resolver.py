"""The ref/code/name/back-create resolution ladder shared by every AutoCount
ingest surface (D1/D2/D10, S1 originally, extracted in S3).

`DocumentIngestService` (sales_orders/purchase_orders) and
`ShippingOrderIngestService` (shipping_orders) both resolve the same five
masters - customer, supplier, sales agent, product, warehouse - by the same
ladder: ref, then code, then (supplier only) name, then back-create. Lifted
out to a base class rather than duplicated, so a shipping order and a
document can never resolve the same code two different ways. A base class
rather than free functions because every step reads `self.db` /
`self.company_id` / `self.integration_id` / `self.refs`, set up once by
`__init__` - a caller composes those four things once and every rung uses
them, exactly as `DocumentIngestService` already did before this extraction.
