"""Collect the REQUIRED fields an ask needs before it runs (LOWSTOCK-FILTER-ASK, owner Q2).

`documentation/plans/chatbot/lowstock-filter-ask-behaviour-card.md`. One helper, shared by
every ask that must not run until some fields are settled (the low stock report today,
IDEATION-CAPTURE #1444 next). It knows nothing about any one ask: an ask type registers its
required fields, and the helper owns the rest.

The rule, per field, in the order the ask type lists them:

1. given in the message and valid -> taken, nothing asked;
2. "all" (the message said "all categories", or the reply is "all") -> settled as `ALL`,
   where the field allows it;
3. otherwise -> asked, ONE field per reply, with the field's own question.

Changing what an ask requires is config: add or remove a `FieldSpec` on its `AskType`.

API
---

* `FieldSpec(name, noun, question, resolve, allow_all=True, required=True)` - one field.
  `resolve(db, word, extras) -> Resolved` reads a typed word: `Resolved("ok", value, label)`,
  `Resolved("ambiguous", options=((value, label), ...))` (the helper lists them with numbers),
  or `Resolved("unknown")`. `extras` is the ask's carried context (below), so a field can be
  read in the light of another word (the low stock report's brand narrows its category).
  `required=False` is a field that is NEVER asked: taken when the message gives it (a
  numbered pick when the word names several), absent otherwise, and an unknown word is
  simply not taken. Flipping it to True is how an ask starts requiring the field.
* `register(AskType(name, fields, reroute, cancelled, give_up))` - one ask, registered
  once at import (`ASKS`). `reroute` is laid over the
  parser verdict when a reply answers the open question, so the turn goes back to the same
  ask (for the low stock report: its intent and domain). `give_up` may hold `{word}`.
* `collect(db, ask, *, given=None, slot=None, reply=None, extras=None) -> Outcome`.
  A fresh ask passes `given` (field name -> the raw word the message named, `ALL`, or a
  `Resolved` the caller already settled itself);
  an answering turn passes the `slot` it got back and the `reply` text. `extras` is
  anything the ask wants carried across the question untouched (the low stock report's
  supplier and grouping words). `Outcome.done` -> every required field is settled, run with
  `Outcome.values` (`{name: {"value", "label"}}`). Otherwise send `Outcome.reply` and keep
  `Outcome.slot` (None when nothing stays open: cancelled or given up).
* `reply_verdict(verdict, slot, text, *, asks=ASKS) -> (verdict, rule)` - the engine seam, read
  before anything routes the message. With a question open, a short reply (or one the
  parser reads as the same ask) is the answer: the verdict is rerouted to the ask, its
  entities cleared, and `required_ask` / `required_ask_reply` carry the slot and the text to
  the lane. A message of more than three words that the parser reads as a different ask
  (another intent, or not a business message at all), an empty message, or any message
  with a "?" drops the question (`required_ask_dropped`). An optional field's pick also
  takes "all" / "none", and two misses on it settle it as "no filter" and go on.

The slot is one turn long: the engine consumes it on the next message, and the lane that
asks again hands a fresh one back (`required_ask` on its envelope).
