# Search-scope disclosure: "Customer: X / Product: Y / Dates: Z" ahead of a

#
# A direct port of origin/main's own `tail/compile_state.py::_search_scope_header`
# (deleted on this branch by the S3 turn re-architecture, `129c403c7`): main's whole
# `_AXES` table, the two "always" axes (Customer, Product) plus the four ask-scoped
# ones (Order/Transporter/Container/Warehouse), and the Dates line. The media-confirm
# / escalate-branch / empty-result-set guards main's version carries do not apply here
# - the bridge's own callers already know this is a genuine, single-domain hit before
# they ever reach this module. `tail/` (not `turn/`) because it is free to use `re`
# and to read the resolver's own gate/resolved dicts, the same freedom
# `answer_bridge.py` already has.
#
# Main's best-effort wrapper ("a disclosure bug must never block the answer") lives on
# the one caller, `answer_bridge.apply_scope_block`, which is the whole block main
# wraps: header plus prepend.
