"""Ports of `escalate-catalog.js` and `build-outcome.js` (AC-201, AC-202, AC-302).

Two nodes, one file, because they are two halves of one question: what did this branch
build, and what does it say?

**`escalate_catalog`** is the canned-copy switch. Nine `branch_kind` arms map to a
sentence plus three behaviour flags (`manualResponse`, `includeResponse`,
`is_escalate_offer`) that `compile-current-state` used to derive from a seven-arm
`isExecuted` ladder. The sentences themselves now come from the prompt registry
(`copy.CannedCopy`, AC-302); the flags stay code, because they are routing, not wording.

**`build_outcome`** is the 15-key producer map. `compile-current-state` used to reach
back to eighteen upstream nodes by name; the hub reads them once, at the one point that
dominates every path into ccs, and puts the result on the item. In the CRM there are no
by-name reads to remove - but the SHAPE has to survive, because ccs's own precedence
ladder is written against the map's keys and the replay corpus grades it.

**A producer that did not run is `None`, and a producer that is not in the graph is also
`None`.** That collapse is n8n's own (`_one`'s `catch` swallows "no node named n"), and
it is why the `outcome_fragment` mechanism exists at all: once a producer moves into a
sub, its key goes quietly null forever. The port keeps the collapse for parity and keeps
the fragment override for the same reason n8n has it.
