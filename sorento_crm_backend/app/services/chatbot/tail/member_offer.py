"""The CS member offer: `cs-roster-plan` + the roster read + `build-cs-member-offer`.

Three n8n nodes become three functions, and the HTTP hop in the middle disappears. n8n
runs `get-cs-members` once per plan item against `GET /external/team-members`; the CRM
already owns that service, so `fetch_rosters` calls it in process. The SHAPE it returns
is deliberately the HTTP node's (`{"body": [...]}` per plan item, `{"error": ...}` on a
failure) because `build_cs_member_offer` is graded against captured items of exactly that
shape, and reshaping it would make the corpus ungradeable to save one dict.

**A company whose roster read fails degrades to an empty roster, never to a failed turn.**
That is n8n's `onError: continueRegularOutput` on the HTTP node, and it is the right
behaviour: one company's misconfigured team must not cost the customer the whole offer.
The empty company is then DISCLOSED in the rendered list rather than silently dropped.
