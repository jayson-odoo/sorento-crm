"""Port of `crossdomain-compose.js`: fold the cross-domain block in, re-seal the reply.

It sits between `compile-current-state` and the sender so the escalate phrase reaches the
customer text AND the persisted state in ONE place. Every fail-silent exit returns the
envelope UNTOUCHED, so a turn with no cross-domain block is byte-identical to what the
compiler sealed.

**Two branches, and which one runs is a structural question, not a textual one.** The JS
asked `/^Previous turn \\(/` of the state it had just written; the port takes
`answered_domain` from `CompiledState` instead (R3, D11). On an ANSWERED turn the block
plus the escalate phrase are APPENDED and the quick replies gain the two offer buttons;
on a TOTAL MISS the block is inserted at the start of the winning marker's own line, so
the direct fact outranks a consolation list and never sits below the escalate question.

**The markers are matched case-insensitively.** Several live arms render them in lower
case, and under a case-sensitive scan every one of them fell through to the append-at-END
fallback - i.e. below the numbered picker and below the escalate question, which is the
exact ordering defect this block exists to prevent. Only a lower-cased COPY is searched;
the original string is what gets sliced, so no casing in the customer's text is altered.
