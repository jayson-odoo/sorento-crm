"""`run_turn` - the head of the turn: receive, understand, check access, route.

One inbound WhatsApp message in, `{turn_id, ctx, item, branch_kind, delegate}` out. The
stages the S1 head owns map onto the five nodes it replaces in the live spine
(`get-session-vars`, `Call 'sub-query-reformulator'`, `check-access`, `build-ctx`,
`route-turn`), and `item` is byte-equal to what `route-turn` emits today so every n8n
reader downstream is unchanged (AC-101, AC-110).

**Session discipline.** `run_turn` takes a session FACTORY, not a session. The plan's
capacity section is explicit: never hold a DB session across LLM or MCP I/O, and the
96/100-connection incident is the evidence. The engine opens a session to read, closes it,
makes the parser call with nothing checked out, and reopens to check access and record the
turn. A request-scoped `Depends(get_db)` session could not satisfy that, which is why the
signature differs from the plan's original sketch (the plan is updated in the same change).

**D14, dry run.** `envelope.dry_run` is evaluated FIRST, before anything side-effecting
(H37: n8n called next-assignee and guarded afterwards). On a dry run the only row written
anywhere is the `chatbot.turns` record itself, every action carries `dry_run: true`, and
the response carries `session_patch` - null in S1, because the head writes no session
state; the tail (S2) is what fills it.

    trace showed the contact's real memory while the lane ran on injected memory would be
    the worst kind of unreadable.

    Fix 3 (console defect, contact 437264483, 23 Sep 2026): `session_state.five_keys`
    returns the STORED top-level five keys whenever ANY of them is present on
    `session_vars`, and only falls through to the `variables` nest when none is - so
    writing the harness value into `variables` alone, leaving the stored row's own
    top-level `focus`/`open_question`/etc untouched, meant injection silently did
    nothing for any contact whose stored row was already in the new five-key shape
    (every contact since #952). Two shapes the harness value can take, told apart by
    `session_state.FIVE_KEYS` membership (the same membership rule `_harness_keys_
    present` already uses: `{}` is a real instruction, not "nothing to do"):

    * carries any of the five keys (the console's own echo of `result.session_vars`),
      or is `{}` ("remembers nothing"): every one of the five keys is set from it
      (`value.get(key)`, so an omitted key becomes `None`) - the harness state
      REPLACES the memory for this turn, it does not merge with the stored row's.
    * neither (the legacy flat shape, `contracts.LegacyVariables`): unchanged
      behaviour - it is written to `variables`, and the five keys are stripped from
      `session_vars` so `session_state.five_keys` falls through to its legacy
      projection instead of reading the (now absent) stored top-level keys.

    A harness value that is not a dict at all (e.g. JSON `null`) is treated the same
    as `{}` - the memory is wiped for this turn. The console never sends one; this
    only matters for a hand-built envelope.

    Nothing here writes: the head persists no session state at all (the tail does, at S2),

    **`ctx` and `item` can still be null here, and that is not a defect to fix in the
    engine.** `response` is written by `_close_turn`, so it exists only once the first
    turn has FINISHED. Two cases return nulls:

    * the first turn is still `processing` - which is the LIKELY timing, not the edge
      case: a webhook delivery and a poller re-delivery arrive within the same second or
      two, well inside the 5 to 10 seconds a parse plus an access check takes;
    * the first turn `failed` BEFORE a lane owned it - the early stages (`intake`,
      `received`, `understood`, `access`) close the row with no `response` at all, so
      there is nothing to replay. A failure AFTER a lane owns the turn is different and
      deliberately so: both lane failure paths (`_run_business_answer`'s catch-all and
      the fetch-outage close in `_run_stages`) store the full shape, error reply
      included, so a duplicate of one of those replays the words the caller has already
      sent - which is exactly what stops it sending them twice.

    Making the second caller WAIT for the first would put a poll loop on a synchronous
    request for a message the caller must not answer twice anyway, which buys nothing:
    whatever it waited for, it still sends nothing. **The actual guarantee is on the n8n
    side** - the Switch on `duplicate` sits BEFORE the `build-ctx` / `route-turn`
    re-emitters, so a null `ctx` is never dereferenced (plan, S1 n8n section; AC-110).
    The response body is a courtesy for the trace screen and for a caller that wants to
    log what the original turn decided, never a contract the caller may depend on.

    `status` is the row's own, so `processing` (in flight), `failed` and `delegated` /
    `done` are all distinguishable: a caller that sees `duplicate: true, status:
    processing` knows the nulls mean "not finished yet", not "nothing to say".

    **`is_test` here is the ORIGINAL ROW's flag, not this call's envelope, and that is
    deliberate** (security review round 2, N5). Everywhere else the head stamps
    `result.is_test` from the CURRENT envelope, because the flag describes the call; on
    this path the whole answer describes the first turn, so its flag has to come from the
    same place its `reply` and `actions` do. Stamping the caller's flag on somebody else's
    answer would produce a result whose top-level field and whose per-action `dry_run`
    disagreed.

    Since H57 the two can no longer disagree anyway: the dedup lookup is narrowed to the
    envelope's OWN `is_test` (`_existing_turn`), so a duplicate is always a duplicate of a
    row from the same world and this flag always equals the caller's. The cross-world case
    the previous paragraph used to describe - a test envelope reading back `is_test: false`
    off a live row - is gone, because a test envelope for a message that already ran live
    now runs as its own turn instead of being answered from the customer's.

    The caller's contract does not change: n8n still gets the finished turn on the same

    worker. Off by default; the trigger for turning it on is measured (the plan's capacity
    section: beyond ~250 concurrent turns the API threads, not the model, are the limit).

    Enqueue-and-wait is `app/api/v1/external/media.py`'s pattern, for its reason: a job
    row that outlives the request means a slow turn degrades into a recorded one rather
    than a hung socket.

    **What this does NOT do is raise the concurrency ceiling, and the flag's trigger has
    to be read that way.** `/external/media` waits on the event loop (`async def`,
    `asyncio.to_thread`, `asyncio.sleep`); this endpoint is synchronous, so the wait
    happens on the API's threadpool thread and that thread is occupied either way. What
    moves is the LLM call's CPU and memory, off the API process and onto a worker that can
    be scaled and restarted on its own. Making the wait free as well means making
    `/chat/turn` async, which is a change to the endpoint and not to this function; it is
    named in the plan's capacity section rather than done here, because the measured
    trigger for the offload has not arrived either. The connection half of the same
    problem IS fixed: the request no longer holds a database transaction while it waits.

    asked for a session of its own, the way the escalation lane owns one
    (`escalation_services.production_session`); both ways of doing that were measured on
    16 Sep 2026 and neither works today:

    * An own session NESTED inside this stage's block loses the write in every test.
      `tests/chatbot/conftest.py::session_factory` binds every session to ONE connection
      with `join_transaction_mode="create_savepoint"`, so an inner session's commit only
      releases into the enclosing session's savepoint and the enclosing session's close
      rolls it back. Probed directly: the frame was written, read back as 1 immediately
      after, and 0 at the end of the test. Production is unaffected (each `SessionLocal`
      takes its own connection), but the whole engine suite would be red.
    * Moving the call out of the stage block instead reintroduces the bug this line was
      put here to fix: a turn whose fetch failed or whose lane refused must still close
      the topic it ended, which is why the write sits where APPLY decides `topic_reset`
      rather than on the answer arm.

    Trigger for revisiting: a test fixture that gives each session its OWN connection.

    * `send_attachments` is a SECOND action and only when there is something to send.

      `item.outcome_fragment` - RS-6.1c's own mechanism and the exact key `build-outcome`

    row, which is where `/turn` persisted it - one less thing for the caller to keep
    consistent, and the only thing that makes a retry from the trace screen possible.

    **Dry run writes NOTHING (D14, AC-702's shape).** `is_test` was decided on the

    is what stops a harness key leaking into a customer's session (H15, AC-203), and it
    has to raise before `overwrite_for_contact`, not after.

    `state` is APPLY's `state'`, handed over by the lanes that run inside `run_turn`, so
    the session this writes carries the focus and the still-open question THIS turn
    computed rather than a re-read of the one it started with. `/complete` is n8n's path

    `compose_send_action` is for a lane that finishes IN the CRM and only learns its own
