"""Ordering one contact's turns, and re-injecting a failed one (AC-705, AC-709, AC-710).

Two jobs, one module, because they are the same subject seen twice: WHICH turn for this
contact runs next. The ordering half is the S7 replacement for n8n's `sorento-dispatcher`,
which popped one contact per second and therefore served a 50-dealer burst over 50 seconds
no matter how fast the CRM was. The re-inject half puts an operator's Retry back through
the front door so it takes the same ordering everything else takes.

R4: there is no automatic retry anywhere. An operator presses Retry on the trace screen,
and what that does is put the customer's ORIGINAL message back through the front door -
n8n's inject webhook, the same one the failover poller uses - so the turn re-enters with
the same ordering, the same lanes and the same sending path a live message gets.

**The CRM does not send, and does not re-run the turn in place.** Both would be the same
mistake in different clothes: the engine answering from a click would bypass n8n's egress
containment (D9), and a fresh in-process run would write a reply nobody delivered. What
happens instead is one HTTP POST of bytes the CRM already has, and then the turn arrives
back the ordinary way, as its own row.

**Unset by default, on purpose.** With no URL on the default respond workspace the caller
answers 409 `retry_unavailable` and nothing is posted. A dev machine that silently
injected into production n8n would answer a real customer from a developer's click, and
the failure would look like a bug in the customer's conversation rather than in a config
screen.

**S8a: the URL and key live on the WORKSPACE ROW, not the environment** (AC-804; owner
ruling, 5 Sep: nothing chatbot-shaped in `.env`, it does not scale past one tenant). That
makes them admin-editable, so both are checked by `app/services/outbound_url_guard.py`
before anything is sent - https only, never loopback / private / link-local, never the CRM
itself - and the POST follows no redirects.

From S7 the URL points at the thin spine's own webhook. Nothing else here changes: the
body is the respond.io webhook body either way, which is exactly why this seam is one
function and one row rather than a transport abstraction.

#
#   chatbot:seq:{contact}            the ticket counter. INCR on arrival; a turn's ticket is
#                                    its place in the queue for THIS contact only.
#   chatbot:done:{contact}           every ticket up to here has finished (or died). Absent
#                                    means zero.
#   chatbot:alive:{contact}:{ticket} ONE KEY PER TICKET, present while that ticket's turn is
#                                    alive. Stamped in the same script as the INCR, kept fresh
#                                    by a heartbeat thread (`Heartbeat`), deleted on release.
#
# A ticket may run once `done >= ticket - 1`. `done` only ever moves through `_settle`, which
# walks it forward over every ticket whose alive key is GONE - finished, or dead and lapsed -
# and stops at the first one that is still alive. That one rule replaces three that failed
# on prod (contact 423729104, 1 Oct):
#
# * The old single `running` key was overwritten by every new ticket, so a waiter read its
#   OWN stamp as a live predecessor and the dead-predecessor repair could never fire.
# * A ticket that gave up waiting marked itself done, which let its successors run beside a
#   predecessor that was still working. `_settle` cannot pass a live ticket, whoever calls it.
# * `seq` and `done` expired on separate clocks (seq's TTL refreshed at take, done's at
#   release), so after a quiet hour `seq` restarted at 1 under a stale, higher `done`: ticket
#   1's release was a no-op, the stale `done` lapsed, and ticket 2 waited 45 s for a ticket 1
#   that had finished a minute earlier. The take now resets a `done` from an earlier session.
#
# A turn whose process is killed simply stops heart-beating; its alive key lapses within
# `ALIVE_TTL_SECONDS` and the next poll walks past it. No grace timer, no repair path.
#
# Redis, not Postgres advisory locks: the wait is a poll of one integer, it must not hold a
# database connection while it waits (the capacity rule), and redis is already the queue
# substrate this process talks to. The alive keys are built inside the Lua scripts from a
# prefix because their name depends on the ticket number INCR returns; this is a single
# redis instance, not a cluster.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# message the keys are worthless, and a fresh contact starting again at ticket 1 is
# correct - nothing is waiting on the old numbers.
