"""The contact-to-agent access check, in process.

n8n POSTs `/external/access-agent/check` and puts the response on `ctx.access`. The port
calls the SAME service that endpoint calls, so the item shape on `ctx.access` is
byte-identical - which matters because `route-turn` spreads it into its own output and
every n8n node downstream of the migration boundary still reads those keys by name.

Not an MCP tool and not an HTTP hop: this is a service call in the same process.
`space_id` comes from the default respond workspace row rather than n8n's hard-coded
`364817` (D5).
