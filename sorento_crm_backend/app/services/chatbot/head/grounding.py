"""Grounding: every descriptor the parser emitted, mapped onto the specification registry.

Fix round 8 on PR #833 (owner retest of round 7, 27 Sep 2026): "is it the parser is not
bounded by what the system has as a spec? like it doesn't know colour is colour one meh,
why it become document type one". The parser had entity kinds for a product, a category,
a brand and a document type, and none for a specification value, so every descriptor it
could not place went into `attachment_type`: "pink colour" came back a photo, "thickness
1.2 mm" a technical drawing, and "gunmetal basin" stayed one category token no set could
be scoped by.

The prompt now teaches a `specification` kind rendered from the registry
(`chatbot_parser_prompt.render_prompt_blocks`), and this module is the deterministic half
that runs after every parse, whatever kind the parser picked:

  * a `category` / `product_type` token keeps only what the thing IS (class and type
    words, "basin"); every other registry word in it becomes a `specification` entity
    ("gunmetal" -> Finish or colour: Gunmetal);
  * an `attachment_type` token stays one only when its words are on the attachment-type
    list (a type name, an alias the owner entered, a certificate word or scheme); anything
    else is grounded like any other descriptor, never read as a document;
  * a `specification` token the parser emitted is checked against the registry: its key
    must exist and its value must be one of that key's choices (or a number, for a
    numeric key);
  * a word next to a key's own word that is none of its choices ("pink colour", "f trap")
    is an UNKNOWN value of that key, said back with the ones the registry knows.

No word list lives here. The registry's keys, labels, choices, synonyms and units, the
class vocabulary and the attachment-type table decide; staff editing any of them on
Product Specifications changes what grounds, with no prompt or code change.
