"""Grounding: every descriptor the parser emitted, mapped onto the specification registry.

Fix round 8 on PR #833 (owner retest of round 7, 27 Sep 2026): "is it the parser is not
bounded by what the system has as a spec? like it doesn't know colour is colour one meh,
why it become document type one". The parser had entity kinds for a product, a category,
a brand and a document type, and none for a specification value, so every descriptor it
could not place went into `attachment_type`: "pink colour" came back a photo, "thickness
1.2 mm" a technical drawing, and "gunmetal basin" stayed one category token no set could
be scoped by.

The prompt now teaches a `specification` kind rendered from the registry
(`chatbot_parser_prompt.render_prompt_blocks`), and this module is the deterministic half
that runs after every parse, whatever kind the parser picked:

  * a `category` / `product_type` token keeps only what the thing IS (class and type
    words, "basin"); every other registry word in it becomes a `specification` entity
    ("gunmetal" -> Finish or colour: Gunmetal);
  * an `attachment_type` token is the parser's (ATTACH-GROUNDING-TYPO option (c), owner,
    6 Oct 2026): kept as filed when the parser was confident and its code, whole, is a
    listed document type (`DOCUMENT_TYPE_CODES` or an attachment-type name or code), and
    dropped otherwise. The customer's words are never read for it;
  * a `specification` token the parser emitted is checked against the registry: its key
    must exist and its value must be one of that key's choices (or a number, for a
    numeric key);
  * a word next to a key's own word that is none of its choices ("pink colour", "f trap")
    is an UNKNOWN value of that key, said back with the ones the registry knows.

No descriptor word list lives here (`DOCUMENT_TYPE_CODES` is the parser prompt's own
taxonomy of document codes, not a list of customer words). The registry's keys, labels,
choices, synonyms and units, the class vocabulary and the attachment-type table decide;
staff editing any of them on Product Specifications changes what grounds, with no prompt
or code change.
