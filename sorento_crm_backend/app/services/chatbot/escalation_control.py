# ESCALATION-CONTROL (owner, 30 Sep 2026): "we need to be able to control each contact
# that they cannot access the escalation: cannot force escalate, won't be offered
# escalation; this is for dealer".
#
# A barred contact (`turn.state.escalation_barred`, resolved by `app/services/
# escalation_policy.py`) is never offered a hand-off and cannot force one. The offer
# sites read `turn.state.offers_escalation` at source; this module is the backstop the
# engine runs on every composed reply (`strip_offers`), and the reply the forced path
# gives instead of a hand-off (`barred_reply`).
#
# Pure: no I/O.
