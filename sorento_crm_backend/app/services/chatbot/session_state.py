"""The five-key session shape, read from wherever a contact's row actually holds it.

`respond_contacts.session_vars` is `{focus, open_question, ideation, access_levels,
contains_flyer}` (AC-1504). A contact mid-conversation at deploy still carries the
pre-rearch nest, `{"variables": {...}}`, written by n8n's outer loop - so every read goes
through here and accepts both, and every write goes through `turn/tail.py::persist`,
which only ever writes the five keys at the top level.

This module is the ONE place that knows the legacy nest exists. Nothing else reads
`session_vars.variables`.
