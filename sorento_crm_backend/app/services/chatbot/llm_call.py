"""The ONE seam every model call in a chatbot turn goes through: the semantic parser
(`head/parser.parse`, and so its recall re-parse) and the clarifier
(`lanes/casual.call_clarifier`). Nothing else in `app/services/chatbot` calls a provider.

Owner console test of round 4 (26 Sep 2026, PR #1247, ruling 3): two turns failed with
"Error code: 429 - Rate limit reached for gpt-5.4-mini ... tokens per min (TPM): Limit
200000, Used 200000" and that raw text went to the dealer. A rate limit is a wait, not a
failure: it is retried here with a growing backoff, inside the turn, honouring the
server's own "try again in Ns" when it gives one. Only when every attempt is refused does
the caller get `RateLimited`, and the caller then says `RATE_LIMITED_REPLY`, never the
provider's text (the operator still sees that on the turn row and the trace).

A tokens-per-minute limit clears over tens of seconds, which is why these waits are long.

CHATBOT-QUEUE-FIX (prod 1 Oct, turn a45f): the parser call had NO timeout. The SDK default
is 600 s with two silent retries, and one call took 230 s while the contact's queue slot
waited on it. Every attempt now carries `ATTEMPT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` with the SDK's own retries
off (this loop is the only retry), and the whole call, backoff included, stops at
`CALL_DEADLINE_SECONDS`. A timeout raises `TimedOut`, which IS a `RateLimited`: to the dealer
both mean "the model is busy, send that again", so every caller that already says
`RATE_LIMITED_REPLY` says it for a hang too, and the row keeps the real reason.
