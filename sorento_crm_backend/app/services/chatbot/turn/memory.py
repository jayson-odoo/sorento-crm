    The range is this contact's `chatbot.turns` on the same `is_test` WORLD that are
    not yet part of any of this contact-and-world's frames, excluding the resetting
    turn itself, oldest first - read through the ORM (never raw SQL: `chatbot.turns`
    lives in its own Postgres schema and only ORM constructs go through the test
    fixture's `schema_translate_map`, `turn_runtime.turn_number`'s own docstring).
    Membership rather than a `last_activity_at` cutoff, so a turn that lands with a
    created_at at or before the last frame's boundary (commit-order jitter, a backfill
    replaying history) is still picked up.

    Two guard rails around the membership test, both needed once a caller (the
    backfill script) can call this over turns that ALL already exist rather than one
    at a time as the live engine does:

    * An UPPER bound at the resetting turn's own `created_at`, when it is a real row
      (a synthetic id - `test_two_calls_over_the_same_range_produce_one_frame` - has
      none, and skips the bound). Without it, membership alone cannot tell a turn
      that has not happened yet (in insertion order) from one that is simply not yet
      closed, and a full-history backfill run - every turn already in the table -
      would close ranges out of order.
    * A LOWER bound at the OLDEST currently-surviving frame's `started_at`, when one
      exists. Retention trims by COUNT (`KEEP_EPISODES`), on purpose (contract section
      3 / PLAN 5.5): once a frame ages out, its turns must stay forgotten, not get
      re-derived into a new frame the next time this runs over the same history - or a
      repeated backfill would churn forever instead of being idempotent.

    Empty range writes nothing. The insert is `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` against the
    unique `(contact_respond_id, is_test, turn_ids[1])` index, so two callers racing
    over the identical range produce exactly one frame; the loser reads back `None`
    rather than the winner's row (D14: this path has no reason to disagree with the
    winner's summary). No embedding is enqueued (contract section 3: recall is
    deleted in S3; this writer never had a reader to serve).
