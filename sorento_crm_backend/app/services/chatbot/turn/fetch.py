# builds in production): `ctx.tool_runner(domain, spec) -> dict` is the ONE seam that
# actually reaches a tool (an MCP call in production, a stub in every test), and
# `ctx.trace` is `app.services.chatbot.trace.TurnTrace`, whose `.add(kind, payload)`
# records one `tool` event per fetched domain (contract 129: "one tool entry per

    The ladder is `chatbot_domains.ladder`, walked IN ORDER, and it stops at the first
    rung with rows - the customer asked one question, so they get one answer, from
    whichever domain has it. Every rung goes through the SAME `tool_runner` the primary
    fetch used (same gate, same trace event), and a rung this contact was never granted
    is skipped before the probe runs (`_rung_grant_missing`).

    A rung that answers is appended as its own envelope and the composer prints it as a
    second section under the primary's miss line (contract 122, one section per domain).
    When every rung misses, nothing is appended: the rungs tried are recorded ON the
    primary envelope so the miss line can name them once, which is AC-922's "nothing on
    any rung" shape rather than three empty headers.

    R1 (AC-1688, security review N-1): a rung never runs for a subject that did not
    resolve. The primary fetch is allowed to run with an empty `spec.entities` (that is
    how `_answered_unfiltered` recognises an unresolved-token miss and reports it as
    one), but every rung reuses the SAME spec (`replace(spec, domain=rung)`) - an empty
    entity list would climb the whole ladder and hand each rung's tool the same no-filter
    spec, which is how "ETA cb2805q" once dumped 50 unrelated products under an
    "Incoming" header. Nothing left to narrow BY is nothing to climb with.

    R1 addendum: an EMPTY list is not the only "nothing to narrow BY" shape -
    `narrow.decide`'s `unplaced_never_offered` outcome leaves a NON-empty entities list
    whose members carry no resolved uuid at all (the resolver never placed them), and
    the same unfiltered climb happened for that shape too ("stock and eta for
    SRTWT2634" fired a real `crm_procurement_po_placed_list` call whose args skipped
    every entity `missing_or_bad_uuid`). Refused on the SAME signal
    `lanes/business/fetch.py::entity_ids_transformer` already reads per entity before
    building a tool's `*_ids` (`entity_has_resolved_uuid`, imported lazily to keep this
    module's own import graph the pure one its header describes) - not a second uuid
    rule. A spec with at least one genuinely resolved entity beside an unresolved one
    still climbs: one real subject is something to narrow by.
