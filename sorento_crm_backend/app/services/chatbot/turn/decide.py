# decide(): the ONE reading of a message against the open question and the standing
# subject (owner go, 18 Sep 2026 - "we have been fixing bugs in circles").
#
# Four places used to decide this between them, and they disagreed at the edges: the pick
# helper, the outstanding question's own arm, the focus rules' shared-axis eviction, and
# the generic pending path. They interact on every turn, and every hand pass since the
# second one found a path one of them missed. They all read a `Decision` now, and this
# module is the only place the rule lives.
#
# Four outcomes, and nothing else:
#
#   ANSWER   the message answers the open question - a position, an offered option named
#            by its exact label, a yes to an offer, or "all" over a numbered menu. An
#            escalation offer takes one explicit position or a yes, nothing weaker.
#   REFINE   the message keeps the standing subject and narrows it - the parser's own
#            "only" marker, entities that sit on axes the subject does not hold, or a
#            date window on its own (R15, R24).
#   NEW_ASK  the message names a subject of its own - `entity_op: replace`, an entity on
#            the subject's own axis, or a document named while an outstanding question is
#            open.
#   CARRY    nothing matched. The question stays open, unrepeated, and the message runs
#            as itself (owner ruling, S6 cluster 4).
#
# The Decision says WHAT the message is. Each arm keeps its own EFFECTS - what it writes
# to the focus, the pending and the trace - because those differ by arm and always did:
# a new ask drops an outstanding question but leaves a roster standing.
#
# Pure, like the rest of the package: no message text, no I/O, no imports from the old
# seams.
