# Reconciliation: the resolver is asked for the hinted kind first; a miss with exactly

# tests - `{raw: {kind: hit_count, ...}, ...}` - the real resolver seam lands in S3.

    Hand pass 12 round 4, R7: the map (`turn_runtime.resolve_kinds`'s own `by_token`)
    is keyed by the token the RESOLVER echoes back, which is the FOLDED one -
    `resolve_gate.resolve_entity_body` sends every entity through its own `[-\\s]+`
    fold before the resolver sees it, so "ZZT-CONT-9F" comes back as "ZZTCONT9F"
    (`turn_runtime._token_key`'s own docstring, measured on turn bb921451). Looking it
    up by the raw text a customer typed therefore found NOTHING for any token carrying
    a dash or a space, so a mishinted dashed record key was never rewritten to its
    resolved kind at all - the same class of silent-join failure R1 fixed for
    `unresolved_tokens`, in the one place that still had it.

    Exact text first (a hand-built map, and the common no-separator case), then the
    folded join. `setdefault` on the folded index so the FIRST key wins rather than a
    later one clobbering it, for the rare pair of typed tokens that fold alike.
