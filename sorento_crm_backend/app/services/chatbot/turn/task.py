# Task: what the conversation still OWES, as one axis on the focus.
#
# Ported from PR #1118 (feat/chatbot-dealer-stock-verdict, not merged, owner ruling
# 24 Sep 2026) for chatbot-stock-ask-v2 S3 (PLAN-chatbot-stock-ask-v2-24sep.md, ruling
# R1: "keep #1118's per-product quantity collection (Focus.tasks, StockQtyTask)").
#
# The focus holds what the conversation is ABOUT. It does not hold what is still owed,
# and neither does `pending`: a genuine new ask CLOSES a roster while an owed
# collection must PARK and come back. So a task is its own axis, with its own
# lifecycle, and the roster's one-shot rules are untouched.
#
# SCOPE CUT from #1118 (R1, PRINCIPLES.md "simplest thing that works"): #1118 also
# built an `IdeationTask` kind and a `task_pick` tie between two open task kinds
# (D24(b)) - both deliberately left OUT here. Ideation already has its own
# independent mechanism on main (`app/services/chatbot/lanes/ideate.py`,
# `session_state.py`) that does not need this generic Task wrapper, and a tie between
# two kinds is machinery for a problem that cannot occur while `TASK_KINDS` has one
# entry (at most one task per kind is ever open, so `claimed` below can never exceed
# length 1). `TASK_KINDS = {"stock_qty": StockQtyTask()}` is the only registry entry;
# the `TaskKind` protocol and `run()`'s generic shape stay, so a THIRD kind (real or a
# test double) still drives the same seams with no per-kind arm anywhere else.
#
# Pure, like the rest of this package: no I/O, no message words, no import of `head`,
# `dialogue`, `tail` or `engine`, and no import of `turn/state.py` either (that module
# imports THIS one, for `Focus.tasks`).
