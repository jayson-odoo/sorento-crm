# Held: the ONE rule for every question the bot is holding open (STUCK-QTY-LOOP, owner
# 4 Oct 2026).
#
# Live 4 Oct 02:56-03:00: an availability contact's open stock task replayed "How many
# units for each? 1. SRTWB1086 - ..." on every message - a low stock report, the switch
# to compact and "clear" included - because each kind of held question had its own
# lifecycle and none of them knew about the others' (task.run's RESUME arm took any
# entity-less inventory message as "back to the stock check"). The owner's rule, for
# every question or picker the bot can hold:
#
#   * a held question captures a reply only when the reply ANSWERS it, read off the
#     parser's own fields (no keyword rules);
#   * a message with a different intent that answers nothing is a new question: every
#     held question goes;
#   * a reset (`topic_reset`, the parser's "clear" / "never mind") clears them all;
#   * they expire: `HELD_TTL_TURNS` turns after they last changed;
#   * a question held under other access (stock mode, escalation, reveals) is dropped.
#
# What counts as held is the registry below. `test_held_state.py` fails when a field is
# added to `Focus` or `State` without being classified here, and when a pending kind is
# minted that the rule does not know.
#
# Pure, like the rest of this package: no I/O. Three seams in `engine.py` call it:
# `expire` at load (before the parser sees an open question), `consume` once the verdict
# is read, and `stamp` where the five keys are written.
