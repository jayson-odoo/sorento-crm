# The seeded policy rows for `chatbot_domains` and `chatbot_entity_kinds` (AC-1501,

# these lists, and `policy.load_policy` falls back to them when the tables are absent or
# empty - which is every blank-schema test fixture, since neither table is built by
# `Base.metadata.create_all` alone.
#
# Data only. Nothing here reads a message, calls a database or imports a lane.

# FROZEN SEED DATA (captain ruling, 16 Sep 2026). Any change to the policy goes

# Hand-curated per-TOOL exception lists (AC-1594, S6). Not domain or kind data - a tool's
# narrowing requirement is a property of the MCP argument shape, which has no row in
# either policy table - so these moved here rather than into `Policy`, matching the
# `DATE_PARAM_TOOLS` precedent just above: frozen, reasoned data that lives in the ONE
# seed-data module instead of as a third list on `lanes/business/fetch.py` itself.

# SF6 (security review, PLAN-chatbot-last-purchase-cost.md, 12 Sep 2026): tools whose
# UNSCOPED branch answers every product (or every product at a warehouse) rather than
# refusing, so an entity filter is required rather than merely accepted.
# `crm_resource_attachments_list` - a warehouse/document-type filter is enough narrowing.
# `crm_procurement_po_last_cost_list` also joins for the same reason - see
# `PRODUCT_ID_REQUIRED_TOOLS` below, which narrows its own bar further.

    {"crm_resource_attachments_list", "crm_procurement_po_last_cost_list"}

# SF6: of `ENTITY_FILTER_REQUIRED_TOOLS`, the one tool for which `warehouse_ids` alone is
# NOT enough narrowing - its unscoped branch is a plain top_n cap over every product at
# that warehouse, so a warehouse named with no product is still an unnamed-product leak.
