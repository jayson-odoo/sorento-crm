# route: Plan in, one branch kind out - and nothing else (PLAN-chatbot-turn-rearch.md
# "APPLY contract", AC-1528). Stage D of the seven.
#
# Thirteen branch kinds, but only six DECISIONS (the plan's own stage D: "ask | business
# | escalation | casual | canned | denied"); the kinds are what the lanes, the trace
# screen and n8n's own arm names have always been called, so the mapping stays visible
# here rather than being renamed underneath them.
#
# Two kinds are deliberately absent: `access_denied` from a refused access agent, and
# `stock_denied` / `demand_qty`, which are decided from the CONTACT's own record before a
# plan exists at all (contract 58, 61, 62). The engine settles those before it routes.
