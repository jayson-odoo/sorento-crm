"""The episode digest: a deterministic, no-LLM summary of a closed episode's turns
(chatbot memory lane A, contract section 5.2 / PLAN-chatbot-memory-26sep.md section
5.2).

**No side effects.** No database library, no ORM handle, no database import of any
kind - `digest()` only looks at the turn dicts it is handed, so it is replayable in CI
and safe to call from both the live writer (`turn/memory.py::write_episode_for_reset`)
and the offline `scripts/backfill_chatbot_episodes.py`, over the identical range of
turns, and get the identical answer (AC-MEM029).

**No figures.** A stock count, a price or an ETA is stale by the next day - the summary
says WHAT was asked and HOW it ended, never the number. Outcome is read from structural
signals the engine really writes (reviewer pass at d89110c0, S5): `branch_kind`, the
`apply` record's `plan.ask` and `plan.denied`, the `looked_up` stage's status and its
`facts.missed` / `facts.sections`, and the `memory` record's open question - never from
a rendered reply, which can say anything.

**Readable.** The summary is a grammar-aware template, not a model call (fix round 6):
what the contact asked about, what they got, what is still open, as plain sentences.
The stored text is what the recall reply and the staff Conversations card both show.

Input: a list of turn dicts, oldest first, each shaped
`{id, created_at, branch_kind, status, message, trace, result_refs}` - the same shape
`chatbot.turns` rows project to (`created_at` a datetime, `trace` the same list of stage/
kind records the trace writer already produces: an `apply` kind record with
`verdict`/`plan`, a `looked_up` stage with `facts.missed`/`facts.sections`, a `tool`
kind record, a `memory` kind record whose `open_question.after` is the question the
reply left open, a `replied` stage whose rendered facts are never read here).
