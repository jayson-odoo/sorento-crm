"""The eight branch kinds the CRM finishes itself (S3, AC-301).

n8n answers six of them with `escalate-catalog` and the shared compile/send path, reached
straight off the `route` Switch (`route-turn`'s own `TAG_ONLY` set is what reduces five of
those items to `{branch_kind}`; only `offer_hold` has a Set node of its own,
`tag-offer-hold`). The CRM already has every piece - `route.decide` stamps the item,
`tail/outcome.escalate_catalog` is the catalog, and the S2 tail is the compile path - so
this module is small on purpose: it builds the `sub-output` FRAGMENTS each lane would have
handed the tail, and the tail runs unchanged. No second pipeline, no second copy of the
reply ladder.

Two of the eight are not catalog arms and are handled here:

* **`access_denied`** never reaches `compile-current-state` at all. The `route` Switch's
  `access_denied` output goes STRAIGHT to `sorento-sub-respond-sendmsg-respond5` (no tag
  node on that arm), whose `message` expression IS the whole reply - so the CRM composes
  that one string and skips
  the tail. That is not an optimisation: a contact who is not allowed the agent must not
  have the turn written into their memory, and running the tail would write it.
* **`offer_hold`** has no canned text. `offer-hold-reply.js` COMPOSES the clarify ask from
  the persisted pool, and `escalate-catalog` then reads `clarify_text` off it by reference.
  `offer_hold_clarify_text` is that composer, and it is deliberately a standalone function
  because the same body is deployed to `clarify-company-reply` too (its own header says
  so), which S5 will need.

    The pool is `routing_roster_plan` when it has rows, else `routing_companies`. Names are
    DEDUPED - two pool rows sharing a company collapse to one printed name, and the
    single-name parenthetical still resolves because the parser keys the pick per name.

    Three shapes, and the third is the reason the copy is split in two:

    * two or more names: "Both *A* and *B* teams are listed" / "*A*, *B* and *C* teams ...";
    * one name: "*A* teams are listed" (the JS's own wording, plural verb and all);
