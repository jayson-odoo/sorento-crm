"""The `out_of_scope` lane: hand the turn to a person (S5, AC-501 to AC-507).

Port of the LIVE `sub-escalation` (`fr2u3e6FKg52cPvK` @ `bac9613b`, 10 nodes) plus the
assignment path inside `sub-human-intervention` (@ `ae310ea1`). The live graph is:

    escalation-input -> escalation-context -> clarify-company-gate (If)
        -> [true]  clarify-company-reply       -> escalation-result {arm: 'clarify'}
        -> [false] Call 'sub-human-intervention' -> escalation-result {arm: 'human-intervention'}

**What is NOT here, and why that is the point.** The EXPORT of this workflow carries a
`fresh-entity-gate` and a `clarify-team-gate` / `clarify-team-reply` pair. Neither is live:
they belong to unpromoted builds (B-HB-1 and B-TEAM-1'). Porting them would have shipped
behaviour production has never run, so:

* **H26, the brand half, is closed (#865, owner ruling 27 Sep 2026, fix option 1).** The
  lane still never calls `resolve_and_gate`, but it no longer routes brand-blind: the brand
  of the product the escalation is about (this turn's named product, else the product the
  conversation is focused on) is read off the product row through the `product_brand`
  seam, at the point of use (`_apply_focus_brand`). It used to survive into the escalation
  turn only when some earlier turn happened to mint an offer that stamped it, so a spec
  question answered successfully and then "escalate to marketing" drew the whole team.
* **H27 stays open.** There is no team clarify. A null team is not reachable through the
  real pipeline anyway - `head/output_exchange.derive_routing`'s nullish chain hard-defaults
  `suggested_team` to `customer_service` long before this lane sees it - so the hazard is
  live in the PARSER, not here, and this lane simply carries whatever arrives.

Both are marked `xfail(strict=True)` in the tester's suite, so the promotion makes itself
noticed rather than needing to be remembered.

**D14 is evaluated FIRST** (H37). Live's own `test-guard` If sits ahead of the first
send and everything after it, so a dry run reaches no seam at all: no assignee is picked,
no SLA row is created, no cursor moves. `run()` reproduces that ordering literally rather
than guarding each seam, because "guarded afterwards" is what H37 records going wrong.

**D9: the CRM never sends.** Every effect leaves as an `action` for the caller to execute,
in the order the live graph performs them.

**This lane never writes chat history.** `sub-add-comment-respond` does two things when it
runs - the respond.io comment AND a CRM chat-history POST - and it keeps doing both when the
caller executes the `add_comment` action. Writing the comment here as well would double it:
one row from this lane and one from the sub. There is no import of the chat-history service
anywhere in this module, and `test_s5_no_chat_history_write.py` asserts the row count.

    A SIX-rung ladder, in the live body's order (round 4, owner-approved: `carried_
    brand` is the ONE new rung, added 22 Sep 2026):

    1. `picked_member` - the customer picked a row out of the frozen `last_result_set`, so
       both axes are that row's own, verbatim;
    2. `company_pick` - the parser resolved a company name against the OFFERED pool. It
       sits ABOVE the multi-company arm so a resolvable reply routes instead of re-asking;
    3. `sameTeam` - the roster the offer was fetched with, which splits three ways:
       `prior_state` (one company), `prior_state_no_company` (one row, no id) and
       `multi_company_unpicked` (more than one, nobody picked - the clarify arm);
    4. `carried_brand` - the OFFER TURN's own resolved brand
       (`turn_runtime._accepted_pending_brand`, the SAME acceptance carry the agent half
       already uses), read when NONE of the three roster arms above named one. `same_team`
       is never true in the rearch engine today (`_prev_variables` reads `session_vars.
       variables`, a nest `turn/tail.py`'s five session keys never write), so THIS rung is
       what a rearch "yes" after an incoming/ETA miss actually reaches - measured live
       (SRTSC07, 22 Sep 2026): a bare "yes" carried no brand at all, and the whole
       Packing List team rotated instead of drawing the brand-tagged member;
    5. `stated_brand` - a brand the customer named when no roster was involved at all;
    6. `none`.

    **`focus_product` (#865) outranks rungs 4 and 6, never rung 5** and is applied after
    this function, by `_apply_focus_brand`, because it needs a seam and this function is
    pure. Rung 5 is this turn's own `query_brands`, the customer's explicit brand word, and
    it wins over a product carried in focus (fix round 2, S1). The focus rung is the brand
    of the product the escalation is about, read off the product row. It is not a carry
    that can go stale: the focus product itself drops on a topic reset or a newer product
    (`turn/apply.py::_focus_rules`), and the brand is re-read from the row every time.

    Both axes are always what the `get-cs-members` call USED, never re-derived from this
    turn's `query_brands`: re-deriving would narrow the assignee pool to one the customer
    was never shown. `carried_brand` is the ONE exception to "never re-derived" by
    necessity - the rearch engine has no `get-cs-members` roster fetch to remember a
    brand from at all, so it carries the offer turn's OWN resolved brand instead
    (`lanes/business/gate.py`'s `routing_brand`, stamped onto the pending at MINT time,
    read back here through the acceptance carry) - never a brand this turn re-derives
    for itself, which is what the "never re-derived" rule is actually protecting
    against (see also `_accepted_pending_field`'s own docstring for why the picked-
    member and company-pick arms above stay untouched: their brand is a SPECIFIC row's
    own and must keep outranking a generic carry).

    Owner ruling, 6 Sep 2026, from two console turns that both arrived with
    `routing = {suggested_team: null, suggested_agent: null}` and were assigned to whatever
    team the PREVIOUS turn happened to be routed to - the comment named marketing_product
    for a customer-service person and purchasing for a marketing ask.

    Deterministic throughout, and off structured state only (D11 - the name is the parser's
    own `person_mention`, never a regex over the customer's words):

    * A named person is resolved against the staff roster. One match routes to THEIR team
      with them as the assignee - a person the customer named is a direct pick, not a
      round-robin draw. Two different people sharing the name ASKS.
    * **A miss only asks when the PARSER itself resolved no team.** Review of #700: 70 parse
      outputs in the corpus carry a `person_mention` ALONGSIDE a resolved `suggested_team`
      - a greeting, a signature, a name in passing - and every one of those five names
      returns zero roster hits. Asking there would replace correct routing with a question,
      so a miss falls through to that team.

      The team that decides this is `ctx.parse._parser_raw.routing.suggested_team`, the
      parser's OWN answer, never the derived one - and that distinction is the owner's whole
      case, measured on their turn: "escalate to Nurain" arrived with
      `_parser_raw.routing = {suggested_team: null, suggested_agent: null}` while the
      DERIVED routing had already inherited `purchasing` from the previous turn upstream in
      `output_exchange`. Gating on the derived team would make this gate inert on exactly
      the turn it was written for, which is what the first console run showed. With no
      `_parser_raw` (a mocked parse, an injected ctx) the derived team stands in.
    * A parser team that is NOT an exact catalogue member is NARROWED against the
      catalogue before it is used (owner rule R-a, console pass 4, 7 Sep 2026). One
      member matches - assign it; several - ask over exactly those; none - ask over the
      whole vocabulary. See `_catalogue_teams`.
    * No person, no parser team, and not an acceptance: ask ONLY when an escalation offer
      is OPEN (D1 - the stale offer the owner saw consumed). An acceptance
      (`is_escalation_confirmation`) is assigned to the offered team; with no offer there
      is nothing to be wrong about, so the lane carries on exactly as it does today
      (`test_no_team_clarify_on_live_team_flows_through_unguarded`).

    # from the stale pending offer (`output_exchange`'s nullish routing chain falls back to
    # the previous turn's), so gating on `team` made this clarify inert on exactly the turn
    # it exists for: turn 9a40182a asked "can someone else help me" over a pending
    # warehouse offer and was silently re-assigned to warehouse.
    #
    # TWO conditions bound it, both from the review of #706 (blocker B1), which measured
    # the first cut firing on EVERY acceptance from turn 2 on:
    #
    # * An ACCEPTANCE is never asked. The post-processor's `is_escalation_confirmation` is
    #   the one accept signal (D11 - the lane reads no words), and a bare "yes" over an
    #   offer arrives here with the parser's own team null by construction: the customer
    #   said yes, not "yes, warehouse".
    # * The premise is an OPEN escalation offer, not "a previous turn had a routing".
    #   `output_exchange` hard-defaults `routing.suggested_team` to `customer_service` and
    #   `compile_state` persists it every turn, so the previous routing is ALWAYS truthy
    #   and gating on it made the arm fire on every turn with no named team. The ruling is
    #   about a stale OFFER being consumed; `offer_is_open` is what says one is open,
    #   read through the same function the post-processor uses so the two ends of the
    #   turn cannot disagree about it (an expired member offer is not open, AC-816).
    #
    # H64 / AC-815 USED to keep a second premise here - INHERITANCE, "this turn named no
    # team, its domain derives none, and the team it would assign to is the previous
    # turn's". It is DELETED (owner rules R-a / R-b, console pass 4, 7 Sep 2026), because
    # it could not tell its own case apart from the one it broke:
    #
    #   * H64:   "escalate to marketing",         parser routing null, prev `purchasing`
    #   * mt-r2: "I want to talk to a human",     parser routing null, prev `purchasing`
    #
    # IDENTICAL at this lane, and D11 forbids reading the two messages to tell them apart.
    # So the premise fired on both and the second one is the regression production showed
    # (turns 1f0428cb / 9089ef88, execs 15501799 / 15502378): a request that named NO team
    # was answered with the eight-team menu instead of being assigned. The discriminator
    # has to come from the PARSER, and now does: under the amended contract (this lane's
    # `_catalogue_teams`, the prompt's ROUTING section) `routing.suggested_team` carries
    # the customer's own team word verbatim when it names a team the catalogue does not
    # hold exactly, and stays null only when the customer named no team at all. H64's turn
    # therefore arrives with `"marketing"` and is narrowed above; mt-r2's arrives null and
    # falls through to here, where the ROUTING CHAIN'S OWN RESULT is exactly right - the
    # carried team when a previous turn had one, else the table's default. Not the default
    # unconditionally: a product browse routes to purchasing by the owner's own table, and
    # "talk to a human" straight after it inherits that, which is the pre-#706 chain and
    # live parity (review of #713, blocker B3; both shapes are pinned in

    a `[image message]` style placeholder naming the type, and appends the quoted message
    when the customer replied to one.

    `replyTo` hangs off the WEBHOOK body (`ctx.text.message`), one level above the message
    body the first chain reads - copying its path from the wrong level is the easy mistake
    here, so both are spelled out above.

    Owner ruling 22 Sep 2026, R1 (AC-EQ-1..3): the quoted body is `text` if truthy, else
    `title` (Respond.io's quick-reply quote shape carries only `title`), else the whole
    " reply to: ..." suffix is dropped - never n8n's `undefined`, which is what reading
    `.text` unguarded renders for a quoted message with neither, per the n8n expression
    quoted above. R1 is a deliberate divergence from that expression for this one
    branch, not a port of it, at the time of this port (22 Sep 2026) - no claim is made
    here about whether n8n's own node has since been fixed; a fresh capture that still
    shows `undefined` for this shape is not a regression in this file.
