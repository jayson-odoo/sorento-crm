"""Graceful fallback replies (PLAN-chatbot-memory-26sep.md section 7, slice S4).

A reply to a message the bot cannot answer from data is

    reply = ack            one human sentence, the clarifier's (the ONLY LLM-written part)
          + memory_line    optional, deterministic: from conversations, facts, the CRM link
          + offer          the concrete next thing: a numbered choice, a re-run, a person

Everything here is pure: the engine reads the database (`engine._fallback_context`), the
clarifier answers, and `compose` puts the three halves together from the canned copy.

**The guard (AC-MEM081).** Facts reach the dealer only through `memory_line` and the
composers, which read data. An ack that names a figure, a product-code-shaped token, a
price or a date its own input never had is replaced by the canned ack for the language,
so a model that "helpfully" invents "25 units at RM12.50" never reaches WhatsApp.
