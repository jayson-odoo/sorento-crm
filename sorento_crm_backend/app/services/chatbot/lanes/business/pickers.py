"""Port of `annotate-incoming-picker.js` (35), and the customer picker's has/no-DO stamp.

`annotate_incoming` annotates the picker text the gate ALREADY rendered: same lines, same
order, same numbering, a suffix per numbered line and at most one trailing sentence.
Display only - `compatible_entities`, the roster the next-turn pick resolves against, is
untouched, and that is what makes it safe to run after the gate has decided. `out = gate`:
the annotator MUTATES the gate item and returns it, so the `offer` exit carries the gate's
own keys plus `escalate_message` / `is_clarification`.

The customer picker no longer rewrites text (PICKER-ONE, owner 13 Oct 2026): every
customer roster renders through `turn/compose.py::compose_question`, and its lines are
stamped by `customer_stamp` over `customer_bases_with_do`'s answer, whichever path built
the roster. The port of `annotate-customer-picker.js` is gone with that.

The probe seam is a parameter, not a call: `probe` is whatever `sub-get-results` returned
(`{answers|items: [...]}`), or `None` when it did not run. A probe that FAILED must read as
not measured, never as a confident "no DO" on evidence that was never gathered.
