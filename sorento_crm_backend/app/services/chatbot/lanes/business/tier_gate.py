"""Port of `tier-gate.js` (sub-resolve-and-gate, 230 lines).

Sits between `Aggregate` (the contact's entitlement names) and `If4` on the promotion
lane and decides whether the tier is RESOLVABLE - stated by the customer, or the contact
is entitled to exactly one. It is ALSO the only place the tier x brand -> compound
recomposition happens: `access_levels_recomposed` is what the fetch step sends to the
CRM, and `disallowed-entity-gate`'s Q23 held-check reads `tier_stated`, `entitled_tiers`,
`brand_gate_empty`, `brand_unheld` and `query_brands` straight off this output.

The `mapper-embed` block in the JS is a byte-copy of the n8n repo's own
`tests/offline/access-tier/mapper.js` (49/49 probe, 13/13 mutations). It is ported here
as `parse_level` / `map_entitlement` / `recompose` / `needs_tier_ask` with the same names
so a reader can put the two side by side; nothing about it is re-derived.

The three by-name reads the body makes are parameters instead, because the port has no
`$('node')` to resolve: `j` is `Aggregate`'s item, `parser` is `ctx.parse.output`, and
`item` is the sub's own item carrier (which holds the RS-9 `tier_pick*` stamps that
`Aggregate`'s `{name}`-only output strips).
