"""The `chat_report` ask: what customers ask the bot, ranked or counted (CA-3).

`documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-chat-analytics-ca3-chat-dataset-10oct.md`, slice 5. The lane
half of `crm_report_ask` over `dataset=chat` (`GET /api/v1/order-management/report-ask`). Every
gate that protects data is the ROUTE's (the `chatbot.analytics` reveal, a dealer's customers, a
salesman's customers); the lane gate in `run_fetch` only refuses a contact without the reveal
before any call is made. This module turns the parser's reading into the route's params and asks
for the two fields the route requires, through the shared `required_fields` helper:

* the period (always);
* how many (`top_n`), only for a ranking by an axis that is not a trend. A week, month or day
  breakdown lists every bucket, and a total names no axis.

When BOTH are missing the lane asks both in ONE reply, one per line (card ruling Q1 b, Q2 b, 10 Oct
2026); whatever the answer leaves missing is asked again. Words become ids through the existing
resolvers (the engine's entity gate), never by matching strings here.
