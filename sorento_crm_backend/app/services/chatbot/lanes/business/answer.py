"""Port of the business lane's ANSWER half (S6c, AC-607 to AC-609).

The spine's own nodes between the fetch and the tail: `validator`, `promo-picker`, the
three cross-domain nodes, `build-result`, `If6`/`Aggregate1`, and the two miss-lane
renderers (`not-found-error-message`, `access-level-choice-message`) plus the composer
`build-suggest-offer`. `sub_answer.py` and `miss_suggest.py` hold the two sub-workflows
this file dispatches into.

**Source of truth is the LIVE SPINE's copy of each body**, not the clone's and not
`sub-main-processing`'s: every capture the corpus grades these against came from
`live-spine-sorento-consume-main`, and the three copies genuinely differ (measured:
`build-suggest-offer` is 710 / 729 / 944 lines across them). There are TWO named
exceptions: `build-result` lives only in `sub-main-processing-live` and `sub-answer`, and
the tester's runner passes the sub's five producers, so the 88-line version is the one
ported; and `crossdomain-zeroset`'s domain guard is taken from the same sub's 151-line
body, which makes it a divergence from the shipping spine rather than parity - the shas
are cited at the block and the entry is `divergences.CROSSDOMAIN_DYM_OFFER_DOMAIN_GUARD`.

**Nothing here holds a database session.** Every function here is pure over plain dicts,
and the two seams that do I/O (`AnswerServices.mcp_probe`, `.family_fetch`) are injected
by the caller.

**D11.** Everything after the parser works on structured state. Where a ported body
sniffs raw text - and a few do - the line carries `# D11-reproduced` naming the n8n site,
so a new fuzzy match cannot slip in beside a parity one.
