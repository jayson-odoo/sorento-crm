"""A seat cover is resolved like a product (SEAT-AS-PRODUCT, owner rule 13 Oct 2026).

"Resolving seat cover should just be like resolving product. The domain behind should depend
on what's resolved by the parser, as usual. No new lanes in answering."

The parser's `find.filters` (keys from `product_find.FILTERS`) say the message is about the
products standing in a registered relation to a code it names ("seat cover for SRTWC8122",
"WC for SRTSCBD330-UF"). `as_linked_products` is a RESOLUTION step only: each such code is
replaced by its linked codes (`product_compatibility`, #1590; the data decides the direction,
as `product_find._run_fits` reads it), and the turn runs on exactly as if the customer had typed
those codes. The domain the parser resolved (stock, ETA, files, price, nothing asked) answers
through its own tool and formatter; there is no find reply lane.

Card `documentation/plans/chatbot/CARD-seat-as-product-13oct.md` (crew answers 13 Oct):

* Q2 (b): only a code on a link is replaced; any other code the message names answers as typed.
* Q3 (a): a code that is no product's exact code (a family prefix, a typo) goes on as typed,
  to the resolver's own picker or miss.
* Q1 (a): when no code the message names has a link, the reply is one line per code
  (`NO_SEAT_COVER_LINE`), and nothing is fetched. No code named and none carried: the ask
  line. The engine says these lines itself, before any lane (`engine._run_turn`). A code
  beside them that is no product's exact code sends the turn on as typed (Q3 a).

`filter_items` / `filter_keys` stay the readers of the parse's `find` key (the resolve body's
`keep_typed_codes`, the type-word miss filter in `turn_runtime.make_tool_runner`).
