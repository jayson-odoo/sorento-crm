"""The `sales_ranking` ask: sales ranked or totalled by one dimension (REPORT-ENGINE slice 1b).

`documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-report-engine.md` section 11. The lane half of
`crm_report_ask` (`GET /api/v1/order-management/report-ask`): every gate (grant, audience,
company, location policy) is the ROUTE's, from `contact_id`; this module only turns the
parser's reading into the route's params, and asks for the two fields the route requires
(the period and how many, then, for a ranking, the metric, and always the basis) through the
shared `required_fields` helper. A ranking never defaults the metric or the basis: it asks
(owner ruling, 4 Oct 2026), through `ranking_ask.next_question`, as top selling does.

* `take_words` (engine seam): a FRESH ask's brand, sales agent and category words come off
  the entity list onto `report_ask_words`, so the generic resolver never reads them as
  customers (the top selling lesson, `engine._top_selling_narrowing`).
* `settle` (lane): words to ids, `group_by` to the catalogue's word, the required fields;
  either a line to send instead of running, or the outcome to build the args from.
* `route_args`: the settled outcome as the route's query params.
* `error_line`: a route refusal (403) or a 404, said as one line.
