"""The fetch output guard for a brand-scoped contact (CONTACT-BRAND-SCOPE, AC-17).

Last of three layers (session criterion, raw-SQL filters, this). After a tool returns, every
list item naming a product outside the contact's brands is dropped before the answer is
built. An item names a product by `product_code`, `item_code` or `product_id`, on itself or
in a dict nested inside it; a nested LIST is walked on its own, so a shipment keeps its
header while its out-of-scope lines go.

Only tools marked `filtered` in `contracts.BRAND_SCOPE_TREATMENT` are guarded; a tool missing
from the map is treated as `filtered` (fail closed). A guard that cannot look the products
up (no session, a query error) treats every named product as out of scope, never as in.
Unscoped (no scope given) returns the result untouched.
