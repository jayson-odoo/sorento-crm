"""Port of `sub-miss-suggest` (S6c, AC-607): the lane a MISSED turn takes.

The live graph (`f42de9c6`) has four Code nodes on the did-you-mean spine - `dym-transform`,
`dym-annotate`, `sibling-transform` and the exit `miss-suggest-result` - plus `promo-dym-plan`
on the promotion fan-out. It has NO `build-suggest-offer` of its own: that composer stays on
the SPINE and reads this exit's `outcome_fragment` one hop later (the RS-7 errata), which is
why `build_suggest_offer` lives in `answer.py` and takes the fragment's three members as
parameters.

**Source of truth is the LIVE sub's body**, not the spine's inline copy of the same node
name. `dym-transform` is 561 lines (sha `89bdd18ec79bf82c`) and `dym-annotate` 247 (sha
`a8fc7cdf4887a243`) on `sub-miss-suggest-live@f42de9c6`, verified byte-equal to the export
before porting; the spine ships 421 / 169 of the same names, which are the pre-Fix-4 bodies
and are NOT what the 33 + 10 `sub-miss-suggest-live` captures were graded against.

`dym-transform` and `sub-answer`'s `dym-transform-partial` are ONE body deployed twice - the
node's own header says so - and the normalised diff between them is a short enumerable list
(the `promotion` domain entry, the Fix-4 uuid keying, cross-token dedupe instead of a
five-token cap, `_capForBlock`, and three uuid-keyed output keys). So the planner is written
ONCE here, parametrised by `variant`, and `sub_answer.dym_transform_partial` calls it. Two
independent 500-line copies that must agree byte for byte is exactly how the two lanes'
candidate selection drifts, and the JS itself carries a "keep in lockstep" note on every one
of those functions.

**Nothing here holds a database session.** The two seams that do I/O
(`AnswerServices.mcp_probe`, `.family_fetch`) are injected by the caller.
