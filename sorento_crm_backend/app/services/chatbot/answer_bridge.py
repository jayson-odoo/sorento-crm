"""The bridge between the new turn engine and production's own answer half
(PLAN-chatbot-answer-half-reattach.md slices R3 and R4; AC-1683, AC-1684, AC-1694,
AC-1697, AC-1698, AC-1699 to AC-1705).

One rule: the new engine decides WHICH turn this is; production decides WHAT the reply
says. `question_for` covers the two resolver exits a single-domain business turn can
raise BEFORE a fetch ever runs - `access_ask` (the price-tier picker) and `offer` (the
gate's own ambiguous-customer / ambiguous-product picker). `answer_for` (R4) covers the
MISS half - a genuine absence, either at the resolver's own exit or discovered once a
fetch has actually run - by calling production's own miss chain
(`not_found_error_message` -> `miss_suggest.run_miss_lane`) and the SAME text ladder
`question_for` uses (`tail.reply.compose_from_fragments`, R4's own extraction of
`engine.run_tail`'s body, so both walk one function, never two). Both functions return
`None` outside their own territory, so the caller falls back to `turn/compose.py` for
everything else (a multi-domain plan, a lane question, a team pick, R5's own hit arm).

**Bridge home, captain ruling 20 Sep 2026**: this module lives OUTSIDE `turn/`, as a
sibling of `turn_runtime.py` (the existing impure adaptor between the pure core and the
kept `lanes/business` + `tail` seams) - `turn/`'s own purity guard
(`test_rearch_s2_apply_is_pure.py`) forbids any file under that package from importing
`chatbot.tail`, and this module imports `tail.outcome` / `tail.reply` / `tail.compose`
freely, by design. No file under `turn/` may import this module either
(`test_rearch_r3_answer_bridge.py::TestTurnPackagePurity`).

**Access arm has two triggers, exactly production `complete_answer:1578-1588`**:
`exit_kind == "access_ask"` (the resolver's own exit for a contact with NO access rows
configured at all) OR the fetch fragment's own `_fetch_arm == "tier-ask"` (the real
"entitled, must pick a tier" path - `resolve_gate.run` exits `"continue"` here; the ASK
is decided one step later, inside `lanes.business.run_fetch`'s own tier-ask arm, once
the per-tier promotion probe has run - that is where the has/no-promotion stamps come
from). `tier_source` is `fetch` on the second trigger, `payload` on the first - measured
off `lanes/business/__init__.py::run_fetch`'s own `fetch_result` shape.

**MEASURED TRAP**: `answer.access_level_choice_message`'s own `tier_last_result_set`
rows carry `entity_type: "access_tier"` (`answer.py:324`), which
`turn/apply.py::_set_kind_field` does not recognise - only the literal `"tier"` reaches
`focus.tier` (`_CODE_ONLY_FIELDS`). Every tier option this bridge mints is rewritten to
`entity_type: "tier"` before it goes anywhere near `pending.ask`.

**The miss arm's two triggers (R4), exactly `lanes/business/__init__.py::
complete_answer:1650`**:

  (a) `payload["_exit_kind"] == "not_found"` - the resolver's own exit, nothing resolved
      at all (H11's zero-tool case). No fetch has run; `envelope` is `None`.
  (b) `envelope["raw_fragment"]` is the error arm `business._error_fragment(...,
      outcome="not_found")` mints - a genuine absence discovered once a fetch actually
      ran (`turn_runtime.make_tool_runner.runner`'s own "answered unfiltered" fallback,
      or a document tool refused for want of a filter). `payload` handed to the miss
      chain folds the fetch item in exactly as `complete_answer`'s own `delegate_payload`
      does: `{**payload, "fetch": fetch_item}`.

`answer_for` returns `None` for a hit-shaped envelope (R5's own arm), an `access_denied`
error arm (that refusal path is unchanged) and an infrastructure error arm (`outcome`
neither `not_found` nor `access_denied` - `complete_answer` RAISES on this arm today; a
caller reaching it here must not quietly render it as a miss). A multi-domain plan is a
CALLER-side decision (the engine never calls the bridge for one) and keeps `turn/
compose.py`'s own copy (owner ruling, Hazards section).

**Every question the miss arm raises is a `Pending` minted by `turn.pending.ask`
(AC-1684)**, in precedence order (mirrors `engine.run_tail`'s own `_question_offered`,
the same precedence `tail.reply_ladder.compose_reply`'s `result_set` reads):

  1. The CS member offer (`producers["build-cs-member-offer"]`), when it built one -
     `member_offer`, options from `cs_last_result_set`, `respond_user_id` on the
     payload so an answering turn can assign by it.
  2. A did-you-mean / require-specific roster (`offer["suggest_last_result_set"]`) -
     `{entity_kind}_pick` (contract 36 roster), options in printed order, each carrying
     the SAME has/no stamp the text prints (derived from the composed text itself - none
     of `run_miss_lane`'s own roster rows carry a `stamp` field, only the rendered line
     does), `payload["domain"]` / `payload["escalate_offered"]` so a pick continues the
     ORIGINAL ask (AC-1704).
  3. A plain escalate offer with no roster at all (`producers["escalate-catalog"].
     is_escalate_offer`) - `team_pick`, the same one-option "Yes" shape `engine.run_tail`'s
     own `_question_offered` mints for a canned lane's escalate catalog.

**AC-1705's cross-domain stock ladder** rides on every miss attempt
(`_run_crossdomain_ladder`, run BEFORE the miss text so its own team-name mutation
lands first - hand pass 9 item 2 - then `_apply_crossdomain_render` folds its render
onto the composed text afterwards): `answer.crossdomain_zeroset` / `run_crossdomain`
already gate themselves to `domain_hint in ("incoming", "inventory")` and a genuinely
resolved, probeable product, so calling them unconditionally is a no-op (no MCP call at
all) for every other domain's miss. `tail.compose.crossdomain_compose` folds the
rendered block above the escalate marker, exactly as it would for the (dead, pre-rearch)
`complete_turn` path - this is genuinely NEW wiring for the single-domain miss, not a
reattachment of something the new engine already ran (measured: neither function has a
live caller on this branch before R4).

    read 0 on hand climbs the SAME cross-domain ladder a miss does, instead of
    printing the zero stock summary alone. Production's own HIT arm
    (`origin/main lanes/business/__init__.py:1585-1650`) calls `answer.
    run_crossdomain` on every answered turn, not only a miss; the caller's own
    `envelope_missed` gate keeps this bridge's MISS arm and `turn/fetch.py::_climb`
    from ever reaching a HIT at all (rows exist, so neither trigger fires), which is
    the gap this closes - one ladder per turn either way
    (`bridge_owns_ladder` covers this arm too).

    `envelope` is the fetch's OWN envelope (`turn_runtime.envelope_of`'s return) - its
    OWN rows live under `figures` (`envelope_of` renames `fetch.answers` to `figures`
    on the way in; `turn/fetch.py::_fetch_one` never re-adds an `answers` key of its
    own). `crossdomain_zeroset` needs the ORIGINAL `answers`/`fields` shape
    (`_envelope_items` tries `answers` before `items`, and `_field_val` reads each
    row's `fields`) - `figures` already carries that shape verbatim (`envelope_of`'s
    own `figures = [r for r in rows if isinstance(r, dict)]`, no re-keying), so
    `{"answers": envelope.get("figures") or []}` is the adapter, not a second reader.

    inventory/incoming (`crossdomain_zeroset`'s own gate, `lanes/business/answer.py:
    481-484` - a statement about the hint, never about which domain this HIT's own
    fetch actually answered) and for a turn with nothing zero to probe
    (`_run_crossdomain_ladder`'s own "no MCP call" case), so calling this
    unconditionally on every single-domain HIT costs nothing on the other ~99% of
    turns. No `domain` parameter of its own (nit N-1, security review): nothing here
    ever read the fetched domain, and the docstring naming it invited exactly this
    misreading.

    BEST EFFORT, the same convention `apply_scope_block` uses one function up: a
    turn that genuinely found rows must never fail because this ladder could not
    run.

    Security N-3 (hand pass 11 security review): a rung that fires appends
    `tail.compose.crossdomain_compose`'s own locked "Would you like me to escalate
    to X team?" phrase to `text`, but minted no `Pending` of its own - the miss arm's
    identical phrase does, through `_miss_question`'s bare "Yes" arm, so a customer's
    "yes" answered a HIT-side offer with nothing to match against. `_crossdomain_offer_
    pending` mints the SAME `team_pick` shape, team off the rung's own `_xdBlock["team"]`
    (`lanes/business/answer.py:1079`, set from `crossdomain_zeroset`'s own `team`
    read at `:489` - the exact value the phrase itself prints; owner ruling 22 Sep
    2026, R6 retired the PO-rung override that used to overwrite it after the fact,
    so this is now the question's OWN origin-domain team, unconditionally).

    `focus_products` (hand pass 12 round 3, R5, owner ruling): a DID-YOU-MEAN PICK
    runs no resolver of its own (`resolver_payload is None`, the SAME fact `_ladder_
    resolved`'s own docstring names for the MISS arm), so `resolved` alone has nothing
    for `crossdomain_zeroset`'s own `resolved.intersection` read to climb from - the
    ladder fired for a DIRECT ask (a fresh resolve) but never after a pick settled the
    SAME product. Fed in the SAME shape `_ladder_resolved` already builds, from the
    FOCUS carry `apply_scope_block`'s own `focus_products` parameter already reads
    one call up (`engine.py`'s `state_out.focus.products`) - the picked product's real

    """AC-1705's cross-domain stock ladder: `answer.run_crossdomain`'s own call, split
    out from the FOLD below (`_apply_crossdomain_render`, hand pass 9 item 2) so a
    caller can run this BEFORE building any text that reads the ladder's own render,
    then fold the SAME result's render afterwards - never a second `run_crossdomain`
    call, which would probe twice for one fact.

    Owner ruling 22 Sep 2026, R6 retired the reason this split originally existed:
    `_apply_crossdomain_rung` no longer mutates `parser["routing"]["suggested_team"]`
    at all (`_CROSSDOMAIN_RUNG_TEAM` is deleted - a stock-origin ask is ALWAYS
    warehouse and an incoming-origin ask is ALWAYS purchasing, whichever rung answers,
    so there is no team update left for a caller to race). Ordering still matters for
    a different, unrelated reason: the ladder's own RENDERED TEXT (the "but PO is
    placed" block) has to exist before `not_found_error_message` / `miss_suggest.
    run_miss_lane` compose the miss reply, so `_apply_crossdomain_render` can fold it
    in - this call still has to run first, it just never again changes which team the
    escalate sentence names (that is now `turn_runtime.lane_parse_output`'s own
    domain-aware fallback, filled before this function ever sees the parser dict - see
    that function's own docstring).

    `answer.run_crossdomain` gates itself to `domain_hint in ("incoming", "inventory")`
    and at least one probeable (uuid-carrying) product (`crossdomain_zeroset`'s own
    domain/probeable checks) - calling it unconditionally on every miss is therefore a
    genuine no-op (no MCP call, `render=None`) for every other domain, never a second
    ladder policy of this module's own. `item` defaults to `{}`, equivalent to main's
    own validator item on a MISS: `crossdomain_zeroset` reads that item for
    `returned_codes` alone, and on a miss that set is empty either way. Hand pass 11,
    defect 1: a caller answering a single-domain HIT whose rows read 0 on hand (the
    ladder never used to reach a HIT at all - `envelope_missed` is false for it, so
    neither this bridge's own miss triggers nor `turn/fetch.py::_climb` ever ran)
    passes the validated fetch envelope here instead - `crossdomain_zeroset`'s own
    `_rows_all_zero` per-code read (`dh == "inventory"` only) is what turns "found but
    every row is 0" into a `zero: True` miss entry the SAME ladder probes for.

    Every OTHER argument is the one `complete_answer` hands its own `run_crossdomain`
    (`lanes/business/__init__.py:1685-1710`), reviewer B3/S2:

    * `entities_names` is the resolver aggregate's own `name` (the contact's entitled
      level names). `None` skips `crossdomain_probe_args`'s intersection entirely and
      sends the PARSER's claimed `access_levels` verbatim, so a level the customer's
      words named but the contact does not hold reached the probe. This bridge passes
      `[]` rather than main's `None` when the aggregate did not run, which is a
      DELIBERATE fail-closed divergence: the intersection then keeps nothing and the
      unverified claim is dropped. `[]` is inert today only because no tool the ladder
      can reach reads `access_levels` at all (`crm_inventory_stock_balance_list`,
      `crm_incoming_stock_list`, `crm_procurement_po_placed_list`; the rung probe does
      not even send the key) - a future rung on an access-level-gated tool would inherit
      the "empty means no filter" reading B1 was about, and must pass the entitlement
      here instead (security N5).
    * `crossdomain_ladder` is `system_settings.chatbot_crossdomain_ladder`
      (`engine._crossdomain_ladder`). `answer._next_crossdomain_rung` returns `None`
      for a non-dict ladder, so without it the SECOND rung - the PO rung, migration
      `491_chatbot_ladder_incoming_po`, owner ruling 8 Sep 2026 - never ran at all.
    * `trace` is the turn's own `TurnTrace`, so the rung probes appear on the trace
      screen under this turn rather than nowhere.
