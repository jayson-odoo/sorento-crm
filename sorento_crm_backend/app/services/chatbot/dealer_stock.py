# The dealer's stock ask never offers an escalation (owner ruling 26 Sep 2026, hand
# test F1: "dealer ask cannot have escalation, cannot have direct escalation to
# warehouse, their contact point is sales person").
#
# A dealer is an availability-only contact (`Profile.stock_availability_only`). Every
# place a stock ask would say "would you like me to escalate to warehouse team?" or
# store a team pick says "Please refer to your salesman." instead, with no pending
# question; a did-you-mean becomes a pick of the suggested code(s), carrying the typed
# quantity. Staff contacts (detailed / compact) never reach this module.
#
# Pure: no I/O. Lives outside `turn/` because it reads reply TEXT (the escalation
# sentence a composer already printed), which the turn package never does.
