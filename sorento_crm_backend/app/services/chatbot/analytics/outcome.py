"""How a closed turn ENDED, read from its trace: the pure half of the chat facts (CA-1).

**No side effects.** No database library, no ORM handle, no import of one: `turn_outcome`
and `flatten` only look at the turn dict they are handed, so the live hook, the nightly
sweep and the tests all get the identical answer from the identical trace (the same
promise `turn/episode_digest.py` makes for episode summaries, and the same reason the
outcome is read from structure the engine really writes - `branch_kind`, the `apply`
record's plan, the `looked_up` stage's `facts`, a handful of kind events - never from a
rendered reply, which can say anything).

**No customer words, ever.** The `turn` dict a caller builds may carry the customer's
message; nothing here reads it. An entity travels only as its `canonical_code` (a CRM
code the parser resolved), never as the `raw` words the customer typed, and a shown row
travels only as its `code`, never its label. `tests/chatbot/test_chat_facts_outcome.py`
pins that with sentinel strings.

Input: the `memory._turn_to_digest_dict` shape plus `status`:
`{branch_kind, status, trace}` where `trace` is the list of stage records (`stage`,
`status`, `facts`, `raw`; NO `kind`) and kind events (`kind`, `at`, ...) the engine writes.
