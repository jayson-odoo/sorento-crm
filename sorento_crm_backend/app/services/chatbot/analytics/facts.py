"""The database half of the chat facts (CA-1): turn trace in, fact rows out.

`record_turn` writes the fact for one closed live turn (the engine calls it right after
the turn commits), `sweep` fills every closed live turn that has none (the one-time load
and the nightly safety net), and `snapshot_episode` writes the analytic row of a closed
episode from inside the frame writer's own transaction. The classification itself lives in
`outcome.py`, which is pure; this module only reads the trace, looks the contact and the
catalogue up, and writes.

**The writer runs with no company scope.** It is called from the engine, a script and the
scheduler, none of which carries a caller. `products`, `brands` and `respond_contact_customers`
are company-owned, so an ORM read of them on such a session returns nothing (fail closed),
and a dealer would be recorded as `unknown`. They are therefore read as CORE tables
(`Model.__table__`), which the ORM scope listener does not touch - the same trick, for the
same reason, as `reports/datasets/sponsorship_forms.py`.

**Nothing here copies what a customer wrote.** The turn dict handed to `outcome` carries no
message; the fact keeps codes and CRM ids only.

**Failure never costs a turn.** The engine calls `record_turn` after its own commit inside
a try/except, and `write_episode_for_reset` calls `snapshot_episode` inside a SAVEPOINT, so
an analytics error leaves the turn closed and the frame written. The sweep refills what a
failure skipped.
