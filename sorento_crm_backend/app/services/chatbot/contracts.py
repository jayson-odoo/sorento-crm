"""The chatbot turn engine's vocabularies and payload shapes - ONE declaration each.

H28 is enum drift: n8n listed `branch_kind` in the router, again in the Switch it fed,
and again in `escalate-catalog`, and the three lists stopped agreeing without anything
failing. Every vocabulary the engine speaks is therefore declared exactly once here, as a
tuple plus the `Literal` built from it, and `tests/chatbot/test_contracts.py` greps the
package for a second copy.

Naming follows the wire, not Python taste: `qf` keys, `ctx` keys and `session_vars`
members keep the names n8n uses, because a rename is a contract break with the caller and
with 1,535 captured fixtures.

    parser tagged `domain_hint: "purchasing"` for "IBWB248什么时候会到仓库？" - "purchasing"
    is a TEAM name (`lanes/escalation.ESCALATION_TEAMS`), not a domain - and
    `select_tool`'s

    `source_id` is `implemented::crm_incoming_stock_*`), so the turn ended `not_found`.
    That filter is GONE since 8 Sep 2026 (the lane picks the domain row's own first
    tool, and a team name resolves to no row), so the same turn ends the same way for a
    plainer reason. The guard stays: a domain outside the enum must not reach any reader.

    A domain reaches a turn from exactly TWO places, and both call this:

    * the parser's emission, at `head/output_exchange._post_process`;
    * the contact's STORED memory, at `engine._drop_unknown_carried_domain` - which is what turn
      fca4aa5e-806b-4403-aa2e-fc2d0961fb2d proved the emission guard alone does not
      cover. That turn's parser emitted a clean `incoming`, and the carried
      `variables.domain_hint: "purchasing"` (written by an earlier turn, or by n8n) was
      adopted over it by `resolve_gate.retype_shipment_miss` - one of EIGHT sites that

    Guarding the two entry points rather than the eight inheritors is what keeps this one
