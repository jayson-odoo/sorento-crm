"""REFER-SALESMAN (owner ruling 30 Sep 2026, `PLAN-refer-salesman-30sep.md`): every reply
that refers a dealer to their salesman is a Customer asks row.

The stock ask (`stock_availability`) already writes its rows from the fetch's own entries
(`engine._stock_ask_answered_entries`). This module covers the OTHER refer replies - a
dealer's incoming ETA reply, an incoming or stock miss, a code the resolver could not place,
a "no" to a did-you-mean, and (CUSTOMER-ASKS-REFER-ONLY, 1 Oct 2026) every reply a barred
contact (#1406) is referred in - by reading what the turn already knows: the fetch
envelopes, the plan's resolved entities and the question the dealer was answering.

Whether the reply refers at all is NOT read off its text: the caller passes `referred`, the
turn's own mark (`turn/refer.py`, set by the one helper every composer prints the line
through) or a stock ask line the presenter stamped `refers_to_salesman`.
The entries it returns take the same road as the stock ask's
(`stock_ask_service.after_answered_turn`), so there is still ONE writer of `stock_asks`.

Pure: no I/O. Lives outside `turn/` because it reads reply TEXT (the refer sentence a
composer already printed), which the turn package never does - the same reason
`dealer_stock.py` lives here.
