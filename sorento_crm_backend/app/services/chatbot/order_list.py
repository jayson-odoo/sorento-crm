# The order list conversation: a delivery order, sales order or outstanding list the
# customer is reading, and the words that move it (#1262 fix lane round 7, the owner's
# hand test of round 6, 27 Sep 2026).
#
# Two seams, both in `engine._run_stages`:
#
# * `order_list_verdict` reads the message against the open list BEFORE the verdict is
#   applied, the way the top selling lane reads a message against its ranking: a brand
#   word alone switches the brand and re-runs the list (R3), the clear words drop the
#   brand and re-run it (R5), and a fresh order ask that names its own subject but no
#   brand starts with all brands (R4). The parser's own reading of these messages is
#   not stable (v40 read "how aobut mocha" as a request for help), so the words decide.
# * `list_reply` takes the escalate offer and the routing picker out of a reply inside
#   the list, and says an empty result in one line (R6). The escalation lane stays one
#   message away: a request for a person never reaches a business reply at all.
