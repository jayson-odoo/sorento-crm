"""A dealer's delivery order list ask carries a date range of at most 31 days.

DO-ASK-SIMPLIFY rules 3 and 4 (`documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-do-ask-simplify-2oct.md`,
owner answers 2 Oct 2026). A DO list ask is a fetch of one of `fetch.ORDER_TOOLS` that is
not a quantity ask and not one of the order-status buckets (outstanding, SO outstanding),
which have no delivery date to range over. For a dealer:

* no range: nothing is fetched and the bot asks which period, suggesting this month and
  last month (rule 3);
* a range longer than 31 days, inclusive, rolling: nothing is fetched and the bot says how
  long the asked range is, suggesting its last and its first month (rule 4);
* an ask that names one or more DO/SO/order numbers needs no range.

The reply names its suggestions as words to type, not numbers to pick, so the answer is an
ordinary dated message the engine already carries onto the open ask (the subject stays on
the focus), and no pending question has to be armed.
