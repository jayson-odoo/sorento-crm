        Two things about ``doc_number`` decide this, and neither is negotiable:
        it is UNIQUE across the whole table, and a draft HARD-deletes (D48b).

        A sequence derived from a COUNT of the surviving rows therefore re-issues
        a number that a deleted draft already spent, and the next create died on
        ``price_tag_requests_doc_number_key`` with a 500 - the salesperson's Save
        Draft simply stopped working after any delete. A COUNT scoped to one
        company had the same fault across companies: the constraint is global, so
        the sequence has to be global too.

        MAX over the four-digit suffix answers both. It is read with the company
        scope OFF for the same reason: the numbering space is the table, not the
        partition, and a scoped read would hand the next company a number that is
        already taken. Nothing but the number is read.

        ``company_id`` stays in the signature because the caller has it and a
        future per-company prefix would need it; it does not narrow the sequence.
