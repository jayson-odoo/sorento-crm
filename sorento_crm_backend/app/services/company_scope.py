"""Central, fail-closed company-scope enforcement.

Two SQLAlchemy events, registered ONCE at import time (via
``register_company_scope_listeners()`` called from ``app/main.py`` AND the worker
path) so BOTH the API process and the RQ worker enforce isolation - the worker
never runs ``main.py``'s ``startup_event``, so anything registered only there is
absent in the worker (mirrors ``lookup_write_listener``).

1. ``do_orm_execute`` (Session): injects a per-entity company predicate into
   every SELECT touching a ``CompanyScopedMixin`` model, reading the four-state
   scope from ``session.info['company_scope']``.
2. ``before_insert`` (Mapper): auto-stamps ``company_id`` from a single-company
   scope; rejects an owned insert that has no company to stamp (AC-D4).

Four-state scope (PLAN §3 F2):
  UNSET (default / absent) -> false()            -> 0 rows (fail-closed)
  None                     -> no predicate        -> all companies
  frozenset({ids})         -> company_id IN (ids)
  frozenset()  (empty)     -> false()            -> 0 rows (fail-closed)

Attachments (``__company_shared__``) are nullable/shared: under any non-None
scope the predicate is ``company_id IS NULL OR company_id IN (ids)`` and under
UNSET/empty it is ``company_id IS NULL`` - shared (form) attachments stay visible
by definition (AC-H5).
