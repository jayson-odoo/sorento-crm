"""The quotation DOCUMENT: one letterhead carrying several priced scopes.

Sits above ``project_quotation_service``, which keeps owning a scope and its version chain. The
split matters: outcome is per scope and is not a property of a revision, so this module never
touches outcome, and the project's derived outcome keeps working untouched.

Three rules are enforced here rather than left to callers, because each has already been got
wrong once somewhere in this codebase:

1. **Rate-only lines contribute zero to every total.** Scope total, grand total and the issue's
   snapshotted total all come from ONE function. Three call sites computing the same sum is how
   a quotation ends up disagreeing with its own PDF.
2. **The recipient block is snapshotted at create.** Read live, a party address edited next year
   silently rewrites what was sent last year.
3. **Issuing freezes.** An issue records the exact version each scope contributed, and
   ``project_quotation_service.is_frozen`` treats "an issue points at this version" as freezing
   it, so the rows an issue claims to hold cannot be rewritten under it.

    Client decision (2026-08-05): the feedback is CAPTURED and the salesperson revises by hand.
    Nothing here opens a revision, re-prices a line or moves an outcome - a customer asking for a
    lower price has not been given one, and a system that auto-revised would put words in the
    salesperson's mouth. What this owes them is the message, the moment, and a notification.

    Three refusals and one silence, each mirroring the care `accept_issue` already takes:

    * **An empty request is refused** (422). A stamped time with no words behind it renders on the
      customer's page as a settled outcome that nobody can act on.
    * **An accepted quotation is refused** (409). The counter-signature won every scope on the
      issue and moved the project's outcome; a request for changes sitting beside it would be a
      record that says both. The page stops offering the form once accepted, so this is only
      reachable from a stale tab, and it is answered rather than silently dropped.
    * **The same words twice do nothing** - no new stamp, no second activity row, no second
      notification. A double-tap is one request, exactly as a double-tap on Accept is one
      signature. Genuinely NEW words DO get through, which is the property
      ``floor_breach_dedup_key`` exists for: deduplicating the repeat must not silence somebody
      who came back with something else to say.

    The read is taken ``FOR UPDATE`` so two submissions from the same thumb serialise instead of
    racing: without the lock both see a null note and both notify.

    The reverse order is deliberately ALLOWED. Somebody who asked for changes can still decide to
    sign, and refusing a signature the customer wants to give would be worse than the mixed
    record; the request stays on the row as the history it is, and acceptance is what the page
