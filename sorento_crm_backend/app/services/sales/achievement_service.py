"""Live achievement of target periods, counted from sales orders at read time (plan 3.2, 16.2).

Nothing is stored: sales orders keep arriving and changing from AutoCount, so a stored figure
would go stale (trigger for a snapshot: plan 3.1). One query per screen covers every period
shown, whatever mix of subjects, metrics, bases and scopes they carry.

**Which lines count for a period.** `sales_order_lines` of a sales order that is not
cancelled, on a line that is not cancelled (the sales report's own predicate), with a non-null
`order_date` (a null date never counts, either basis), inside the target's product scope
(a category counts its sub-categories, through a recursive CTE over `parent_category_id`; a
brand counts every product whose `brand_id` is one of the target's brands), and
credited to the subject:

- **An agent** (G2, R2): the order's `sales_agent_id` is the agent or one of their label
  siblings, the visible agents sharing the agent's non-empty `person_label`.
- **A team** (T2, R2): EXISTS a stay of a member in the team whose window covers the order's
  date and whose agent (widened to label siblings) is the order's agent. EXISTS, never a join,
  so an order counts once for a team even when two members share a person label. The window
  always reads the SALES ORDER's date, also for DO-dated quantities.

Both come down to one set of credit rows per period, `(agent_id, valid_from, valid_to)`, built
in Python from the small agent and membership tables and checked with one EXISTS.

**How much a line counts** (`achievement_value_expr`): ordered amount is `line_total`, ordered
quantity `qty_ordered`, both when the order date is in the period. Delivered goes through
`delivered_by_date`: the linked DO quantities dated in the period, counted in DO date order
and capped so a line never counts more than `qty_ordered` in total, plus the residual AutoCount
reports delivered that no linked DO explains, on the order date. Amount delivered is
`round(line_total x delivered / qty_ordered, 2)`, 0 when nothing was ordered, the sales
report's `confirmed_value` exactly while no DO is linked.

**Company.** Every read is an ORM statement run through the session, and the achievement query
also names the company explicitly on every table it reads (`sales_orders`, `sales_order_lines`,
`orders`, `order_lines`, `product_categories`, `sales.target_scope`): the scope listener's
criteria do not reach inside a CTE, so a DO line of another company linked to this company's
sales order line would otherwise count. `any_do_linked` applies the same rule, so the Counts
label and the figures always agree.

**Shape (review round 2, B1; #1319).** The credited agents' lines are bounded first: by the
agents' index and the order date span of all the periods (plus, when a period counts by DO
date, the lines a DO dated inside that span links to), typed UUID to UUID on every company
column, so no line outside every period is read. Each source then reaches its periods through
the credit rows, joined on the agent (a hash join), so a line meets only the periods whose
subject credits its agent, never every period. Credit windows are merged per (period, agent)
in Python, so that join yields each line once per period. The DO lines are aggregated once:
`do_counted` gives each linked DO line its capped quantity; its per-(period, line) sum on the
DO date and its per-line total are unioned with the lines dated in each period and grouped
into one row per (period, line). The product scope is resolved once, the category tree walked
once, into a small (target, scope, product) set a hashed IN reads; an all-products target
reads none of it.
