"""Purchasing's own order inquiry: every raised row, across every subject.

**Why this exists next to `project_order_inquiry_service`.** That one reads the rows of
ONE project. Purchasing does not work a project at a time, and more to the point it
cannot: an order adopted from the AutoCount book has `project_id` NULL by design
(`PLAN-fulfilment-planning-from-autocount-so.md` section 2), so its rows belong to no
project and no per-project query will ever return them. Confirming supply on an adopted
order raised rows that were reachable only from the one sales order that raised them.

**The shape is not invented here.** It is the workbook purchasing already works from -
`JAN - DEC 2026 ORDER.xlsx`, sheet title `ORDER INQUIRY`, columns SO DATE / S/O NO / ITEM
CODE / QTY / TOTAL QTY / DELIVERY DATE / PROJECT/CUSTOMER / SUPPLIER / PO NO, one sheet
per delivery MONTH plus a tab per day showing what was raised that day. The columns are
read off that file rather than retyped, the month is the primary axis rather than one
filter among many, and the export writes the same workbook back out.

**SUPPLIER and PO NO are never guessed.** On their sheet a blank in those two columns
means "not placed yet", and that is exactly what the system knows: the only link the
schema holds between an inquiry row and a placed purchase order is the row's SPO
reference, through `spo_allocations.po_line_id`. A row with no such link prints blank
rather than the product's usual supplier, because purchasing reads that column as a
statement that an order exists.

**Each of the screen's own controls is computed ignoring its own filter** (the month
strip, the supplier list, the project list, the people who raised them). A control that
empties itself the moment it is used cannot be used a second time. The visible TOTALS
honour every filter, month included, because that strip is a statement about what is on
screen.

#
# S2 (AC-OH-20..23, `PLAN-oi-worklist-one-header.md`): a row with no decision at all is
# NOT necessarily the header's own answer either. Every row born since G4 is born

        COMPANY-SCOPED BY HAND (AC-D14), AND THE PREDICATE IS NOT REDUNDANT. The session
        listener (`company_scope.do_orm_execute`) injects `with_loader_criteria` for the

        correlated sub-select spliced into the worklist's own query, which names

        #992 (one-header-per-SO) taught `_base` to hide a `cancelled` row from every
        filter that does not explicitly ask `state=cancelled` (S5/AC-OH-50..51) -
        because THIS reads `_base` too, a query that used to match a cancelled row no

        then refused, never a row the filter never showed the buyer - the dialog's
        "Skipped N" and the toast have to agree with what was on screen. A filter that

        window - never a reason, never "early" (owner ruling 16 Sep).

        Mutates each link dict IN PLACE with `suggestion`: `{"kind": "reallocate",
        "candidates": [...]}` naming EVERY OTHER linkable row of the same product with
        open need (never a row on the SAME SO line), delivery date ascending then open
        need descending - the first candidate is the suggested target (ruling 17 Sep:
        list all, earliest first) - `{"kind": "unlink"}` when there is none, or `None`
        on a received link, one still inside the window, or one of the two S3
        exemptions below.

        S3 (review round 1, `PLAN-oi-cascade-skip-early-arrival.md`): a link the
        automatic pass was TOLD to honour regardless of the window earns no pill
        either - a link THIS row's own SO claims live, or one whose document the row
        cites (`ProjectOrderInquiryService._cited_documents`, the same reader the walk

        HAND-placed link exactly as for an automatic one (AC-EA-14/15) - the exemption
        is the evidence, not who pressed the button.

        Review round 2 (F1): "claims live" is read through the WALK's own claim reader
        (`ProjectOrderInquiryService._prime_claims` / `_dedication_for_target`), not a
        second predicate - a first cut here filtered `scm.order_link_claim.resolved_at

        claim regardless, AC-EA-17) nor sufficient (the walk refuses a RESOLVED claim
        whose sales-order line has since SETTLED, AC-EA-16 - `resolved_at` says the
        pairing was found, not that the order still wants it). One reader, never a
        second spelling of "this row's own SO claims it".

        ONE grouped query for the whole page's candidates (AC-RL-23), and ONE priming
        read for the page's triggered claims (S3/F1, `_prime_claims`) - never one per

        Read off the LINKS since section 3.I, which is what makes the two figures true
        again. Before it, a cascade SPLIT a line's rows and the pair was "sum the placed
        siblings" against "sum the raised siblings" - correct only because the split had
        moved the arithmetic into the row count. A row now keeps its full quantity and
        carries links, so per `so_line_id`:

        * `taken` - the sum of every LINK on the line's rows, whatever document it names;
        * `remaining` - the sum of `least(qty, what the line still owes) - linked` across
          them, which is exactly `scm.committed_v`'s own confirmed leg (migrations 422 and
          511) and therefore exactly what still flows to reorder planning. The cap is 7.3
          (owner 14 Sep evening): SO368872 / SRTWC286-SH had 352 of its 364 delivered, so
          Remaining 302 beside a Buy card reading 0 was the screen contradicting itself
          while the engine went on buying the 302 (reviewer S1, 15 Sep).

        Scoped to the verbs `committed_v` counts: `ORDER` and, since part 2 section 4b,
        `ORDER_BACK`. Rows in `actioned` / `cancelled` are out, as they always were.

        A row a planning change REDIRECTED to replenish the shared pool
        (`planning_change_service._apply_placed_redirect`, the captain's ruling 21 Aug
        2026) is excluded from both: it is still real linked quantity, just not this
