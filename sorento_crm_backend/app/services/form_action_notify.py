"""Who gets told when a committed form action is reversed (AC-N-1..N-7).

Three audiences, and each is told a different thing:
  - the person the form went BACK to: you hold this again;
  - the person whose task was VOIDED: that task is gone, by whom, and why;
  - the contact: a correction, but only when the committed action had already told
    them something (AC-N-5) - an undo of a purely internal transition does not message
    the customer.

Every send is best-effort. The reversal has already committed by the time this runs, so
raising here would report a completed undo as a failure.
