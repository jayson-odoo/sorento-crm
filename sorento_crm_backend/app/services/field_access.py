"""Which fields an agent may be told, as data rather than as code.

Replaces the first design, which invented a whole access agent
(`container_status_enquiries`) just to unlock a hardcoded list of clearance
fields. That does not scale: a contact asking "when does my container arrive" is
already routed to `incoming_stock_enquiries` (53 contacts hold it), so gating on a
second agent means every one of them needs a second grant, n8n has to know about
an agent it never routes to, and every future sensitive field means another agent.

Here the agent stays the FUNCTION ("incoming stock enquiries") and the fields it
may reveal are rows.

**Three-way answer, not a boolean.** A denial has a reason and the reason matters
to the caller, because "you were never given this function" and "you have the
function but not this field" are different admin actions:

    ALLOWED             visible
    AGENT_NOT_ASSIGNED  the contact does not hold the agent that owns this field
    FIELD_NOT_ALLOWED   the contact holds the agent, but not this field
    CONTACT_NOT_FOUND   no contact matched at all, so no grant was ever consulted
                        (usually a space_id from a different workspace)

**Only registered fields are gated.** `GATED_FIELDS` lists what is protectable per
resource; anything absent from it is always visible. That is what keeps every
existing response byte-identical - the gate can only ever take away fields that
were added deliberately to the registry.

**Default deny for gated fields.** A newly registered sensitive field is invisible
to everyone until an admin adds a row. The alternative - visible until someone
remembers to restrict it - is how the ETA delay ends up in a dealer's chat on
deploy day.

**Enforcement lives in the data endpoint**, not in a check the caller must
remember to make. `check_attributes` exists so n8n can phrase a refusal without
fetching ("I can't share the gatepass date"), but it is a convenience: forgetting
to call it must never be the difference between safe and leaking.
