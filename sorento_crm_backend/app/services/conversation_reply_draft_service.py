"""AI assist for the ticket composer: draft a reply from the visible thread.

UAC AC-L5, slice S4.4. Deliberately NOT a new AI surface - it reuses the CRM
assistant's existing plumbing end to end: the prompt comes from the prompt
registry (`conversation_reply_draft`, editable and versioned in the FE like
every other key), the provider/model come from the same per-agent resolution
`spec_understanding` uses, and the spend lands in the same
`ai_assistant_usage_logs` table.

Shaped as ONE bounded call, not an agent loop: no tools, no retrieval, no
compute. The output goes into a STAFF MEMBER's input box for them to read and
edit, which is exactly why it can stay this small - the human is the validator,
and nothing here can reach a customer on its own.

Where it deliberately differs from `product_spec_understanding` (the closest
sibling): that one DEGRADES to a deterministic reading when the model is
unavailable, because a search that silently got worse is better than no search.
There is no deterministic fallback for "write a sentence to a customer", so this
one RAISES instead: a button that quietly does nothing is worse than one that
says the assistant is not configured.
