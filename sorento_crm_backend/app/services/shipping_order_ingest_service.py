"""Ingest DOCUMENTS pushed in by the ESB: shipping orders (D3/D5/D11, S3).

A shipping order has no header table. It is a GROUP of `spo_allocations` rows
sharing one `spo_number` (migration 420), so this is the one entity on the
ingest surface with no single `entity_id` to name in a verdict, and no
`integration_references` row to identify it by either: a push finds its rows
by `source_doc_ref` (AutoCount's DocKey), falling back to `spo_number` alone
for a document's first sync - exactly the way `DocumentIngestService._header`
adopts a v1 document by its number, without the reference lookup a header
row would otherwise give it.

Shares the ref/code/name/back-create ladder (`MasterRefResolver`) with
`DocumentIngestService` rather than duplicating it - both subclass it.
Everything else here is peculiar to a header-less document:

**A line still owns its identity.** AutoCount's DtlKey (`source_ref`) is the
upsert key within the document, same as a sales/purchase-order line - a line
keeps its row, and therefore its GRN links and order-link claims, across
every re-push.

**xlsx-era rows are adopted, not replaced (D11).** The purchase-history import
wrote thousands of `spo_allocations` rows before AutoCount owned any of them,
with no `source_ref` at all. The upload's OWN dedup key is `(product_id,
upper(location_code))` (`outstanding_import_service._spo_line_plans`), so
adoption matches on that same pair rather than on `warehouse_id` - the book
routinely names a location this system holds no warehouse row for. Exact
first (that pair plus `warehouse_id`-or-None and outstanding, all agreeing),
then the pair alone when exactly one candidate remains, then position
(`spo_line_number` order) when nothing else discriminates - the same
three-pass shape `document_ingest_service._adopt_lines` uses, with the roles
of "coarse, durable" and "tight, secondary" key components swapped to match
what a shipping-order row actually carries.

**A leftover line closes, it never deletes.** Same reason as a document line
(A3): `scm.order_link_claim.spo_allocation_id` and a GRN's picking line point
at the row's id, and removing it would either cascade a real receipt away or
orphan a pairing already made. `line_status='closed'` takes it out of
`scm.on_order_v` while leaving whatever points at it intact.

**Status is validated, not stored.** The row has no header column for it -
only `line_status` (`open`/`closed`), derived from quantities the same way
`outstanding_import_service._write_spo_lines` derives it. `cancelled` is the
one exception: it forces every line closed regardless of what is still
outstanding, since a cancelled shipment covers no demand however much of it
had already arrived. Every other canonical word is accepted for its
vocabulary check alone and changes nothing about how a line's own status is
computed.
