        summary builder) keep today's single-scope result. A single-company
        attachment is never widened, so its payload is unchanged (AC-G3).

        ``company_id`` lets a caller that already holds the attachment ORM
        row (``_attachment_response_with_linked_entities``) pass its
        ``company_id`` straight through instead of this method re-querying
        ``Attachment`` for it. Left at the sentinel default, this method
