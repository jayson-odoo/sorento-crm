"""The multi-order planning board: dates across, products down, one pile per location.

Contract: `documentation/plans/scm/PLAN-fulfilment-planning-from-autocount-so.md` section 13,
and the Phase 1 shapes in
`sorento_crm_frontend/app/(protected)/project-sales/_shared/types/fulfilmentPlanning.types.ts`.

The board is a LENS. It writes nothing, holds no decision object of its own, and creates no
status: `projects.so_supply_decisions` stays keyed per sales order, and a cell cuts across
orders, so a cell could never be the unit of persistence (13.4). Everything here is a read.

Four ideas carry the file.

**Nothing about supply is recomputed here.** Free stock is `ProjectSupplyService`'s own
figure through `free_stock_by_location`, and the division of one location's pile is
`attribute_sources`, the same pure engine the per-order sheet runs. What the board adds is
the ORDER the pile is served in, which is the one thing that genuinely differs (13.5).

**The ranking is the reorder engine's policy, not a second one.** `scm.priority_policy`
through `app.services.scm.priority.factors_for_demand_rows` - same row, same
`SUM(w*v) / SUM(w present)`, same rule that an absent factor is dropped from both sums and
never scored zero. The board states which policy produced what is on screen, and says so when
that policy separates nothing at all rather than showing a plausible-looking order it did not
earn.

**Every date keeps its own column.** There is no aggregate for the past: a line owed in July
2022 is shown in July 2022, marked as past, not merged into an "Overdue" pile with everything
else. The earlier build had that pile and on real data it swallowed 160 of 160 lines into one
column, which is precisely the schedule the planner opened the board to read.

**Allocation is per (product, LOCATION), never across.** Free stock at one warehouse cannot
cover a line that must be fulfilled from another; moving it is a transfer, which is M9's job
and a non-goal here (13.7). One cell therefore legitimately spans several locations, and the
source strip says which.

**The contest is shown, not hidden.** `_free_stock` nets CONFIRMED holds only, so two orders
composed separately can both be proposed the same stock and the second only finds out when
its confirmation is refused (13.5.1). Here they are in one cell: the higher-ranked row takes
the stock, and every row that lost is marked `contested` with a reason naming who took it.
The locking fix belongs to the confirmation path and is not attempted here.

        goes for PO created, so it cannot be all quantity are free because we got so many
        outstanding SO, right?"

        The list ADDS UP to the total by construction: both are summed from the same rows, so a
        drill-down can never justify a number the strip did not print. The predicate is the
        shared one - `SalesOrder.status = 'open'` plus `is_open_demand()` - so this screen,
        `/scm/sales-orders` and the netting engine cannot disagree about what is outstanding.
        Deliberately every demand class, because a dealer order occupies the stock as
        completely as a project one does.

        Bounded by nature: one product at one location. The widest on the live book is 289
        sales-order lines (B2155-NL-BLUE at BRW-BB), so this is a page, not a report.

        ORDERED BY DELIVERY DATE, and carrying neither a rank nor a queue state (R5, 27
        August 2026). The rank belongs to the queue screen, which exists to explain a
        ranking; here it competed with the question this list answers, which is what else is
        claiming this stock and when it is wanted. `line_ids` are the lines the drawer was
        opened for - the cell's own contributions - and their rows come back marked
        `is_this_line` so a planner can find themselves in the list.

        **`group` reads the whole SET instead of one bin** (captain, 30 August 2026). Step 1
        of the ladder draws the OWNERSHIP GROUP's pile, not a bin's - a `BRW-IB` line is fed
        by `MWH-IB` stock - so a running balance per bin would answer a question the engine
        never asks. Given `group` (the suffix `IB`, or `pools` for the five site pools) the
        totals and the documents cover every bin of that set, each row carrying the bin it
        sits at, and `bins` states each member's own on hand so the reader can open the walk
        on the pile it actually starts from. The set is resolved through `group_netting`,
        which is the same reader the cell's subtotal prints its net from, so the drill and
        the subtotal cannot come to disagree about who is in the group.

        The captain, reading a cell that said 478 free beside 482 owed: "why is everything
        free, are you sure there is no SO occupying this?" They were right to doubt it - 47,009
        was owed at that location across 289 open lines, and `_free_stock` nets only
        `stock.quantity_reserved` and holds belonging to CONFIRMED decisions, of which the book
        has two. So "free" is very nearly raw on-hand, and printing it alone invites exactly
        that wrong conclusion.

        This changes NO allocation. It states the pressure beside the pile.

        The predicate is the shared one, not a private restatement: `is_open_demand()` plus
        `SalesOrder.status = 'open'`, which is what the worklist, the netting engine and
        `scm.committed_v` all mean by outstanding - so the two screens cannot disagree about
        what is owed. Deliberately NOT narrowed to `demand_class = 'project'`: that filter says
        which orders this screen may PLAN, and the question here is what occupies the stock,
        which a dealer order does just as well as a project one.

        The quantity is `demand_qty()` - `coalesce(qty_required, qty_ordered) - delivered`,
        floored - the same figure the netting engine sums, so a planner comparing this against
        the reorder plan sees one number. It can differ from a board row's own
        `qty_outstanding`, which is what is owed the CUSTOMER (AC-B01) rather than what
        purchasing was asked to cover; they differ only where CS has stated a `qty_required`.

        "Covered" is per LINE, through `is_plan_demand_line()`, so a partially confirmed order
        contributes only its confirmed lines - the same rule `committed_v` applies since
        migration 384, rather than a second opinion about what a decision covers.

        Two questions, and they belong to different owners.

        **Which sources may cover this line, in what order** is `ProjectSupplyService.
        compose_line`: own location, then the shared pool under PLAN 3.3's hot-selling rules,
        then timely incoming, then Buy. That is the sheet's code, called here rather than
        approximated - an earlier build ran a reduced three-source version, and it proposed a
        Buy for a line the sheet would have covered from the pool, so purchasing acting on the
        board and purchasing acting on the sheet disagreed about the same line.

        **Who gets a scarce pile** is the board's: contributions are served in the
        fulfilment-priority ranking (13.5), which is what the per-order sheet structurally
        cannot show. So each pile - the own-location free stock, its dated incoming, and the
        shared pool - is drawn down in board order, and the ladder is then run per line against
        what is left.

        Deliberately NOT pro-rata. Splitting 100 free units across five lines needing 100 each
        produces five short deliveries instead of one complete one and four honest Buys.

        Borrow is not proposed, here or on the sheet: it needs a donor and a reason from a
        person (AC-B09). What the board does is SAY it is available, so a Buy is never printed
        as if the stock existed nowhere.

        / Buy 15 for TPE-9204's three dates, but the board printed the proposal SNAPSHOT
        taken with that revision - "BRW 30" on every date, by an engine that had no pool
        ledger yet - and Approve resubmitted it: "0 of 1 orders confirmed ... BRW now has 1
        free for this line, and 30 was asked for". Ruled: the suggestion is live (option 1);
        the at-decision-time proposal stays in `line_snapshots` for the record.

        walk, not a per-line composition, so the pool and donor ledgers hold across the

        answered from it, so the second delivery date says "the site pools net 1" and
        not the 31 the first date has already drawn from.

        `share_open` and `own_group_open` are the other two ledgers of that same walk, as
        this LINE found them (C3, code review round 4): what is left of each site pool's
        project share, and what is left of the unit's own ownership-group pile. Passed for
        exactly the reason `borrow_open` and `other_group_open` are - the proof has to be
        the answer the engine actually got. Without them question 2 re-offered a pool share
        an earlier line had spent, and question 1 offered the 135 at BRW-BB to the 1,305
        line of the same unit that the 135 line had just taken.

        FIVE ROWS, always, in the WALK's own order (v8, R-A): the site pool's share, our
        own locations, borrowing on hand from a later order, borrowing what one is waiting
        on, Buy. The captain, walking SO381895: "our thought process is simpler now" - so
        the proof is the questions a planner would ask out loud, in the order the ladder
        asks them, each answered Yes or No with the figure that decided it inside the
        words. `OPTION_STEPS` is that order and this list mirrors it; two orders for one
        walk is a reader reconciling two screens.

        Every question is answered even when the line was covered two rows above, because
        "the pool was checked and had none" is the answer to that question and an omitted
        row reads as a question nobody asked. `kind` stays the engine's own internal rung
        key (`own` / `pool` / `cross_group_borrow` / `group_borrow` / `buy`) and is never
        rendered: the reader sees the question.

        A READ, never a second allocator: every quantity here is either one the engine
        already produced (`components`) or one the facts already state, so the trail cannot
        disagree with the proposal it explains.

        Returns the five rows AND the locations questions 3 and 4 actually offered, in the
        order they were offered. The Buy's own sentence is written from that list and from
        nothing else (AC-V4): a second filter over the raw donor set was how the note came

        """Open PURCHASE-order balance per (product, location), netted for what is linked.

        The captain, 25 August: the location table needs a "PO qty" beside the stock, so a
        planner deciding between Buy and a transfer can see that 500 are already on order at
        DC1. It is INFORMATION ONLY - `available_qty` stays `on hand - SO + SPO` - because a
        purchase order reaches a project line only through a link (PLAN section I).

        A line counts as ON ORDER on the same four tests every other on-order reader in this
        codebase applies (`allocation_suggestion_service`, `loading_plan_service`,
        `scm.on_order_v`, and `project_order_inquiry_service._candidates_for_row`, which
        is the reader that decides what may be LINKED):

          * `line_status = 'open'` and a balance still to come. A line fully received has
            nothing left to report;
          * `purchase_orders.status IN ('active', 'partial')`. `decision_service` writes a
            `draft_recommendation` PO per supplier per run, and a recommendation nobody has
            confirmed is not on order - `on_order_v` leaves it out for exactly that reason
            (M4-D5), so counting it here would put a proposal on screen as a purchase;
          * an SPO document is not a PO ("those are SPO, not PO" - the captain, live-testing).
            It is already counted as `spo_qty`, so counting it here would state one arrival
            twice. Excluded by both the source stamp and the number, because the two feeds
            that write the table stamp it differently.

        What an order-inquiry row already claims is then netted OFF, per line and floored at
        zero, which is `_candidates_for_row`'s own arithmetic - so the figure here and
        the quantity that dialog offers cannot disagree.

        The placements are materialised by a TOP-LEVEL query first and netted in Python. As a
        correlated subquery they would join in un-scoped: `CompanyScopedMixin` filters the
        entity a query is rooted at, and a subquery rooted at `OrderInquiryRow` inside a query
        rooted at `PurchaseOrderLine` is not the root. Another company's placement would then
        net down this company's balance.

        Placements are read off `order_inquiry_rows.po_line_id`, which is where a placement
        lives today; PLAN section I's `projects.order_inquiry_links` is its successor.

        Two queries for the whole board, never one per location.
