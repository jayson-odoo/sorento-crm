"""What a price tag is ABOUT: the product behind a bound layer, resolved live.

The canvas edits shapes. This module is where those shapes learn what they are
showing - the code, the name, the dimensions, the spec lines, the photos and the
two prices - so a tag can be designed against the real catalogue rather than
against placeholder text.

Everything here is a READ, resolved at the moment it is asked for. Nothing it
returns is ever written into a saved document (ADR 0008): the document holds a
binding and any text a designer typed over it, and this module answers the
binding again on every open, every preview and every render. That is what makes
a promotion ending overnight change the PDF rather than leave a stale price on a
tag somebody prints next week.

Three rules it does not get to decide for itself:

* **Prices come from ``resolve_prices``.** The promotion window, the audience
  gate and "is this offer worth showing" all live there, and a second copy of
  them beside the tag code would be a second commercial answer.
* **Photos come from ``product_images``.** Trade imagery is tagged ``dealer``,
  and the tag designer is the same gate as the catalogue tile.
* **Set prices come from ``resolve_set_price``.** Ticking members IS the
  formula, and the price on a furniture set tag has to agree with the price on
  the set's own detail page.

    One rule, shared with the catalogue tile (``collection_service._dimensions``

    with different punctuation for the same product.

    A missing single dimension prints as ``-`` rather than collapsing the
    string: "800 x - x 220" says which measurement is missing, "800 x 220" is a
    lie about which is which.

    Trailing zeros go. ``dimensions_length`` is ``NUMERIC(10,2)``, so a row read
    back from the database is ``Decimal("800.00")`` and Decimal's ``g`` format
    keeps the scale it was stored at - which printed "800.00 x 500.00 x 220.00
    mm" on a tag whose flyer says "800 x 500 x 220 mm". ``normalize()`` drops the
    stored scale without touching a genuine fraction, so 12.50 still prints as
    12.5.

    ``Decimal(str(part))``, never ``Decimal(part)``: a measurement that comes
    from the reviewed spec row arrives as a JSON number, which is a Python
    FLOAT, and ``Decimal(407.3)`` is 407.2999999999999886313162278383970260620

    that lands in the read response's ``data_changes``), reused rather than
    recomputed, so what the person is told just happened and what gets
    written to ``data_update_changes`` can never disagree.

    The same steps a manual Update always took (D18): one "Before product
    update" PageVersion snapshotting the pins being replaced, the re-pin
    itself, then an "after" snapshot of the result - except this call covers
    a whole SWEEP at once, so N tags changing between two polls fold into
    ONE before-version and ONE after-version (AC-S8-3), not N of each.

    Each re-pinned tag is stamped with the three S8 columns
    (``data_updated_at``/``data_update_changes``/``data_update_version``) so
    the rail's "updated" indicator can name the change and Roll back
    (``POST versions/{n}/restore``) knows which version undoes it.
    ``user_id`` (AC-S8-15) is the staff member whose poll triggered this
    write - both PageVersions carry it as ``created_by``, an auto-applied
    version is not an anonymous system row.

    AC-S8-16: idempotent both against a repeat call with the same already-
    applied triples (a triple whose diff is already reflected in the tag's
    current pin is dropped before anything is written; an entirely
    already-applied batch writes nothing) and against two pollers racing to
    apply the SAME live edit (the page row is locked ``FOR UPDATE`` before
    ``max(version)`` is read, so a second caller blocks behind the first for
    the rest of this transaction; the whole write also runs inside its own
    SAVEPOINT, so a version-number collision that still slips through costs
    only this apply, not the caller's whole transaction - leaving the pins

    The one resolver behind the designer's left panel, both design previews and
    the print payload, so what marketing approves on screen and what the PDF
    prints are the same numbers from the same call.

    Since r9 (D17) it answers the PINNED data when a tag has a pin: master data
    resolved live on every render meant a price edited on Tuesday silently
    rewrote the proof approved on Monday. The live resolve still runs beside it
    for a request somebody can still act on, and the difference comes back as
    ``data_changes`` for a person to decide. A terminal request skips the live
    resolve entirely - nothing can be updated, so asking master data to say so
    is work with no reader.

    The gate is per TAG since the combos slice: two tags split off one line
    resolve two different basins, so they are drawn from different data and a
    Keep on one must not silence the other.

    The marketing override wins over the pinned offer (D9/AC-S5-7) - it is a
    decision somebody made and logged a reason for.

    ``apply_updates`` (S8): the read seam that WRITES an auto-apply for a
    request in ``AUTO_UPDATE_STATUSES`` - opt-in, defaulting to False, so
    every plain read (the design canvas, the print/export payload, a version
    restore, a direct service call) keeps answering the PIN exactly as it
    stood, and only the two callers that are genuinely a "poll"
    (``GET data-changes`` and the list's touched-row sweep) pass it. Passing
    it from every reader would have master data move a tag the instant
    anyone merely opens the design, which is the r9 pin gate's entire point
    to prevent.

    ``user_id`` (AC-S8-15) is who to attribute the write to when
    ``apply_updates`` actually applies something - the caller's job to
    resolve (a real staff session holding ``.process``), never this

    AC-S8-13: the badge is "seen it or not", not "does a live diff exist
    right now" - a tag ``resolve_request_line_data`` just auto-applied
    re-pins to the live value, so a diff computed on the NEXT poll is empty
    even though nobody has looked at what changed yet. Counted instead on
    ``data_updated_at`` (set on apply, cleared only by Dismiss) for that
    case, OR the live diff for a flag-only status exactly as before - a row
    with neither key (the hand-written shape above) falls through to the
    plain diff check unchanged.
