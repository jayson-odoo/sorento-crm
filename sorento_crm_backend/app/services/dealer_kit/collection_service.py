"""Collections: CRUD and the resolver that turns one into tiles.

Resolution is four steps, in this order, and the order is the point:

  1. **Company scope** narrows the candidate products. It runs FIRST, via the
     ORM filter, so a rule can never match another company's catalogue no matter
     what it says (AC-F8).
  2. **The rule** is evaluated by the SHARED ``app/rule_engine`` over registered
     product facts - not a bespoke filter (AC-F3).
  3. **Set algebra**: rule union pins minus exclusions, ordered (AC-F2). Pure,
     and tested exhaustively in ``collection_membership.py``.
  4. **Viewer resolution** turns members into tiles, deciding per reader what
     price (if any) appears. The document never held one (AC-G1).

Discontinued and inactive products are dropped before tiles are built (AC-G4):
a dead tile in a catalogue is an order someone cannot fulfil.
