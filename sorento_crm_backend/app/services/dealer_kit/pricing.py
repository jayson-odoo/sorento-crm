"""What THIS viewer pays for these products. The only answer to that question.

ADR 0008. The Kit turns a price into something a reader sees on a catalogue
tile, in a quote line, in a bundle heading and in a bundle's saving against
list. Four readers, none of which knew promotions existed, and adding "a dealer
sees the promo price while the promotion is live" to each of them separately
means four commercial rules drifting apart until two screens quote one product
at two prices. So it lives here, once, and every surface calls it.

Three things this owes its callers:

* **Decimal end to end.** No float arithmetic anywhere in here, and nothing
  formatted: a caller receives numbers it renders, never numbers it computes.
  Formatting happens at the edge, once.
* **A price a viewer may not see is ABSENT, not hidden.** A dealer-only offer
  resolves to ``offer_price=None`` AND ``promotion_id=None`` for a consumer, so
  neither the figure nor the fact that an offer exists can be recovered from the
  payload.
* **One query for the whole page.** ``resolve_prices`` takes a LIST for the same
  reason ``primary_image_urls`` does - a per-tile lookup turns a forty product
  catalogue into forty round trips.

The brochure decides WHICH promotion (a page carries at most one, an editorial
choice). The viewer decides WHETHER it applies: access levels plus the date
window, resolved here.
