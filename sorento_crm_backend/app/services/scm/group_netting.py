"""Availability is the OWNERSHIP GROUP'S, never one warehouse's (ladder v4, captain 26
August 2026 - `PLAN-scm-cs-planning-uat.md` section 1d).

Sorento books every sales order at `BRW-<group>` while the stock sits at any
`<site>-<group>`, so a per-warehouse reading misleads twice in one breath: on
`B2155-NL-BLUE` the book shows `BRW-IB` 5290 on hand against 27,804 owed and `MWH-IB`
7000 on hand against nothing, and the two together are ONE pile that nets -15,514. Read
warehouse by warehouse, `MWH-IB` looks like 7000 units free to promise; read as the group
it belongs to, there is nothing to promise at all.

So one function answers "how much of this product does that set of locations actually
have", and every surface that needs the answer calls it: the ladder's own-group rung, its
pool rung, its cross-group borrow rung, the cell popover's subtotals, the order-inquiry
link walk, and (S12) the WhatsApp stock answer. None of them can disagree, because there
is nothing for them to disagree with.

The arithmetic is AutoCount's own, per location and then summed:

    net = sum(on hand) - sum(SO qty) + sum(SPO qty)

signed and never floored - "the IB group nets -15514" is the fact a planner needs, and a
floor of zero reports it as "nothing left", which is a different and much weaker thing to
know. SPO sits INSIDE the net deliberately (section 1d, rung 1): an SPO arriving at
`BRW-IB` is owed to the IB backlog before it is owed to any one line, and counting it
beside the net as separate "incoming" would promise the same units twice. Overdue rows are
in it too, by the 26 August ruling that the book is trusted: a supplier being late is not
evidence the goods stopped existing.

NO DATABASE HERE except through the one constructor at the bottom. The class is fed the
three figures it needs as a plain mapping, so the caller that has already read them (the
board prefetches the same triple for its own cell table) pays for no second read, and the
caller that has not (`netting_for_products`) gets them in one batched pass with no board,
no supply service and no import cycle in sight.
