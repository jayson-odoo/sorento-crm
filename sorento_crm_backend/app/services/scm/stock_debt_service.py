"""Stock Debt: every outstanding sales order without supply, as a month x product balance.

S2 of `PLAN-scm-borrow-ladder-v7-stock-debt.md` (section 3.4), rulings R6/R7, R15, R21, R23,
and R42 (section 3.4b, 28 Sep 2026): purchase orders are supply here again, parked on the PO
line's Delivery date, and a PO line naming a sales order covers that order first.

**The view SHOWS; the board DECIDES** (R23). Nothing here writes, proposes or reserves. It
reads the same book the ladder reads, hands it to `supply_assignment.assign()` - the one
piece of arithmetic both surfaces share - and prints the answer as a balance PER MONTH
(R37: what is debted in August stays in August) with the lines and documents behind each
cell. A cell and its drill are two readings of the same walk: free supply dated in the
month, less what the lines due in it went short of on their own dates.

**One read per input, never one per product.** The page is the whole flagged catalogue
(1,000-2,000 products on the live book), so every fact is fetched for the WHOLE set in one
query and then split by product in Python: on hand, open demand, SPO, PO, the decisions that
pin stock and the links that pin a document. A per-product query here is what would turn a
screen into a minute. The trigger for a persisted debt table is stated in plan 3.6 and it is
this cost - measured, not guessed.

**No debt table** (plan 3.6). Debt is computed from the book, and the parts of it that are
decisions (ORDER_BACK rows, placement links, confirmed allocations) are already persisted by
the board. A table would be a second copy of a derived figure, stale the moment anybody
confirms anything.

    that placed quantity, over the named order's lines for the SAME product, each up to what
    the line still needs once the confirmed holds (`holds`: allocations and placements) and
    earlier S/O pins have spoken. What is left over is not pinned, so it stays free supply

    Before R43 every PO line filled the order earliest-first on its own, so two PO lines

        A THIRD, PO, joins them when `include_po` is set (the board/ladder's own path,
        `assignments_for` - plan v7 R29).

        On hand is `quantity_on_hand - quantity_reserved`, the same arithmetic
        `_free_stock` states: reserved stock is spoken for by a picking or despatch that is
        already under way, so offering it to a sales-order line here would promise the same
        units twice. The confirmed HOLDS are subtracted separately, by pinning them to the
        lines that hold them (`_holds`) - which is the more useful shape, because the drill
        can then say which order has them.

        `as_of` is the CALLER's day, not the clock: an on-hand event is stamped with the day
        the walk starts, and stamping it `date.today()` while the walk ran at a pinned
        earlier date put the stock after every line due between the two, so a board
        simulated at a past date read its own floor as arriving late.

        Debt's own reading (`include_po=False`, `list()`/`cell()`'s own default) counts on
        hand and SPO only - a PO is a plan to buy, not stock anybody has or a shipment
        already moving, and reading it as supply here let a line read `covered`/`pinned`
        off a document that could still fall through.

        Fix round (CI, 25 Sep): R23 is the VIEW's own reading, not the shared assignment's
        - the board and the ladder still net a PO as supply (plan v7 R29,
        `test_ladder_v7_po_never_supplies.py`/`test_ladder_v7_incoming_spo_only.py`'s own
        guards), which is `assignments_for`'s `include_po=True` default reaching here.

        R42 (owner, 28 Sep 2026, supersedes R23 for the view): "unless we follwo the PO line
        delivery date and park it as like a supply". The view reads PO again, and
        `delivery_dated` parks each line on its Delivery date (`expected_date`, the column
        the PO lines tab labels so), falling back to R29's `issue + lead` only when the line
        states none. The board keeps `issue + lead` (`delivery_dated=False`).

        R45 (owner, 30 Sep 2026, PO-NO-AUTO-ASSIGN): `documents_pin_only` (the view's own
        reading, `_assignments(view=True)`) stamps every SPO and PO event `pin_only`, so the
        walk never hands a document to a line: "we cannot distribute the PO quantity like
        that, cause the PO quantity is ordered for a reason, and the user is yet to do
        linking in AutoCount" - and, asked, "this applies for SPO also". A document covers
        a line only through a link (a placement, the book's S/O, landed goods); what no
        link took is free in its own month. On hand is walked as before.

        """What is already promised: confirmed allocations and placement links (R21).

        `include_po` (fix round, CI, 25 Sep): `False` was the Stock Debt VIEW's own reading
        under R23 - a placement link naming a PO line pinned nothing. R42 (28 Sep 2026)
        retired that: both paths read the PO branch, so a placement on a PO line pins it in
        the view exactly as on the board.

        Two shapes, one meaning. A `so_line_allocations` row is a decision holding STOCK at a
        bin; an `order_inquiry_links` row is a placement holding a DOCUMENT. Both bind before
        anybody queues (AC-S2-2), and both are keyed to the CORE sales-order line, which is
        what the demand read above is keyed on.

        **The allocation half is `ProjectSupplyService._hold_query`, not a second spelling of
        it.** That is the one predicate for "this row is holding stock right now" - confirmed,
        located, not an ORDER source, and belonging to no decision or to an ACTIVE one - and
        it is shared with the free-stock arithmetic precisely so the two cannot come to
        disagree. Restated by hand here, it had already lost `confirmed_at IS NOT NULL`, so a
        decision saved but never confirmed held stock on this screen and nowhere else.

        **Each hold carries the bin or document it names.** `assign()` honours a hold whose
        supply is outside the read span (a site pool, an unflagged bin, another group under
        `group=`) off exactly these fields (AC-S2-1b), so the drill still says `On hand BRW`
        rather than leaving a pinned line looking unsourced.

        **A placement on an SPO line that is no longer incoming is an ON-HAND hold at the
        SPO's bin** (SPO-RECEIVED-PIN, owner 30 Sep 2026: "when the SPO is received, it is on
        hand already, so if we still link to the received SPO, it seems like there are more
        quantities than we should have"). "No longer incoming" is `open_incoming_clauses()`
        failing, evaluated in SQL on the row itself, plus the quantity test (`allocated <=
        received`) - the one rule `_supply` drops the same line from supply under, so the
        hold and the event agree. Handed on as an SPO hold, that placement met AC-S2-1b's
        stood-up branch in `assign()` (meant for supply OUTSIDE the span, not for a document
        that is not supply) and pinned an uncapped stand-in SPO to the line while the landed
        goods covered a second line as free on hand. Converted, it pins `min(placement,
        landed)` on the bin's floor, which `assign()` caps at what the bin still holds: a
        bin that has since shipped the goods pins nothing, and the line reads short.

        `span` / `supply_rows` (the warehouse ids this read covers and the events `_supply`
        read for them) decide what "the floor" means for that converted hold. A bin IN the
        span with no on-hand event is a bin the read looked at and found empty, so the hold
        is dropped rather than stood up out of nothing - `_landed_holds` pins under the same
        rule. A bin OUTSIDE the span (a site pool, an unflagged bin, another group under
        `group=`) is one the read cannot see, and the promise is honoured the way every other
        out-of-span hold is (AC-S2-1b). Neither given (a caller that only wants the holds
        listed), every converted hold is returned.

        `lendable_lines` (STOCK-DEBT-LENDABLE, the view only): the line keys that can wait
        for a re-buy. A converted received-SPO placement on such a line is `lendable` - it
        IS the line's landed goods (SO381065's 88 at BRW-BB reach the assignment this way,
        through the auto placement on SPO-2026/05-0001, and `_landed_holds` then nets its
        own read to nothing), so without the mark here the feature lent nothing on the real
        book. A decision hold (`so_line_allocations`) is never lendable: it is a Reserve
        somebody confirmed, not goods that landed for the line. `None` marks nothing.
