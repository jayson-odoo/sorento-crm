"""Who gets what, and what is left over: one product's supply assigned to its demand.

PURE maths, no I/O, golden-tested in isolation - the same discipline `coverage_timeline`
keeps. Months are a DISPLAY grouping of dated arithmetic (ADR-0011): no quantity is ever
netted inside a bucket, so supply arriving on the 25th cannot cover demand due on the 3rd.

**A month states its own month, and nothing else** (R37, 30 Aug 2026). What is debted in
August stays in August. The balance of month M is the supply DATED IN M that is still free
when the whole walk is over, minus, for each line due in M, what that line was short AT ITS
OWN DATE. A running balance was carried before, and it read as a fresh debt every month
after: `1/2" ULTRA CIRCULAR` printed -4 in August and -4 again in every later column, while
the drill for those columns was empty, because the cell was an accumulation and the drill
was a month. A line that later supply clears (`late`) still books its shortfall in its own
month - it went without on its own date, and that is the fact a planner acts on - and the
supply that cleared it is no longer free, so it is never counted a second time.

**The question.** "Is this product short, when, and whose order is the one that goes
without?" The balance alone answers the first two; the assignment answers the third, and
that is the one a planner acts on. The Stock Debt view (S2) prints both; the ladder (S3/S4)
reads the same answer so the board and the view can never disagree about what is free.

**The walk** (`PLAN-scm-borrow-ladder-v7-stock-debt.md` 3.1, rulings R14 / R21 / R24 / R31).

1. **Pinned holds bind first, at any date, and PINNED MEANS PINNED** (R21, AC-S2-1b). A
   confirmed decision or a placement link is a promise already made; re-deciding it every
   time somebody opens a screen is what pinning exists to prevent. The pinned quantity
   leaves the pile before anybody queues for it - and when the supply it names is OUTSIDE
   this call's span (a site pool, a bin flagged out of planning, another group when the
   caller narrowed with `group=`), the hold is honoured anyway, off the bin the hold itself
   names. The hold IS the supply: somebody confirmed it against real stock, and dropping it
   because the reader narrowed the question printed a board-covered line as `short`.
2. **Then ONE chronological walk, with a pile per ownership group, and a group draws its
   OWN pile and nothing else** (R40, 30 Aug 2026). The group is the warehouse code's suffix
   (`BRW-BB` -> `BB`), which is the pile ladder v4 nets (`group_netting`); the site pools
   are one further group of their own, because a pool is reached through
   `pool_warehouse_id` and is nobody's ownership group.
   Supply lands in ITS OWN group's free pile at its arrival date, and a demand line draws
   from its own group's pile, oldest first, at its own date. **UNDECIDED DEMAND NEVER
   CROSSES A GROUP.** The captain, on a BB line of 507 with no inquiry and no planning
   sitting on IB's pile: "who is us to decide those BB group takes our IB pile". Nobody -
   so the walk does not decide it. Cross-group movement exists only as a PINNED hold, born
   from a board decision somebody confirmed (step 1 above), and until that Confirm the other
   group's pile is untouched. The ladder still OFFERS it (`free_piles_at`, read by
   `use_candidates_for`), which is a PROPOSAL a planner accepts or does not.
   What a line cannot draw is an OPEN SHORTFALL, and the next supply to arrive in ITS OWN
   group clears the group's open shortfalls, earliest required date first, BEFORE it becomes
   free for a later line - which is what makes this first-come by REQUIRED DATE rather than
   by arrival, and it is the case AC-S2-1 pins.
3. **A past-due line is read at today.** Its date has gone; a column for a month that has
   gone is a column nobody can act in. So it queues at `as_of` (ahead of everything dated
   later) and its debt lands in the CURRENT month (AC-S2-5).
4. **Unlocated, TBA and undated lines draw nothing** (R14). A line with no warehouse cannot
   be sourced at all, a line dated on or after the policy's `tba_date_from` is a placeholder
   and a line with no date states nothing, so none of them may take stock a dated, located
   line will need. Their whole quantity is debt, in their own bucket. Unlocated is tested
   FIRST: no location is a fact about what can be done, and it holds whatever the date says.
5. **An overdue document counts as supply after a GRACE PERIOD** (R-O, 3 Sep 2026,
   superseding R31). A document whose arrival has passed is still owed on its outstanding
   balance - the captain, on SO419417: "Available for Project" at BRW read 355 off 725 SPO
   units dated 24 July and 6 August while the ladder lent 4 off the 11 on the floor, and
   the display was the honest one. So a late document counts as supply landing on
   `as_of + overdue_grace_days` (policy, `scm.priority_policy`, default 14): a line due
   before that day gets nothing from it, and a line due after it is planned against the
   ASSUMED date, which is the date the event carries from here on. The date the document
   itself states is kept beside it (`SupplyEvent.stated_at`) so a screen can print both.
   **R31 stays for the DEAD**: past `overdue_dead_days` of lateness (default 90) the
   document counts as nothing and is RETURNED (`uncounted`) rather than dropped, because a
   document nobody mentions reads as a document that is not there, and chasing it is the
   action the screen exists to prompt. Undated incoming is uncounted for the same reason
   from the other side - there is no date to place it on.

**Status.** `short` when anything is left uncovered, `pinned` when a decision holds it,
`late` when what covers it arrives after its date, `covered` otherwise. Short outranks late
because a line half covered late is still a line that goes without.

    ONE walk over every group, and **a group draws its OWN pile and nothing else** (R40).
    Each group keeps its own free pile and its own queue of open shortfalls; a line draws
    its own group's pile, oldest first, at its own date, and an arrival clears its own
    group's open shortfalls before it becomes free for a later line of that group.

    The 30 August draft let an undecided line reach into the other project groups' piles,
    on the reading that free is free. The captain refused it on the live book - a BB line of
    507 with no inquiry and no planning had silently eaten the IB pile - and the rule is
    now: an undecided line is a line nobody has decided anything about, so the walk decides
    nothing about it either. Another group's stock reaches this line only through a PINNED
    hold (step 1 above), which is a Confirm somebody pressed. The OFFER still exists and is
    still made - `free_piles_at`, read by the ladder's `use_candidates_for` - because
    proposing is not assuming.

    A SITE POOL is sealed off for a second reason on top of that one: taking pool stock is
    the pool RUNG, which raises an ORDER_BACK (R34), so it could never have been a free draw

    of the group that OWNS it - its own earlier lines have queued, its later ones have not.
    It is the wrong question of a group being asked to lend, and the captain's production
    cell is what that costs: `BRW-IB` held 2,237 on hand against 2,684 of open IB demand,
    1,708 due on or before 5 October and 976 after, and the pile read 785 free on 5 October

    BRW-IB ... free stock is owed to nobody", off a group 447 short on its own book.

    So a lending group's offer is bounded by this: what it holds and what the assignment
    counts as coming - which is the walk's own reading of a late document and not a second
    one (R-O): a late-but-alive document is in `supply` at its assumed date and counts here
    too, and a DEAD one is in `uncounted` and counts as nothing (R31). Less ALL of its open
    demand, less any CONFIRMED hold another group has already taken out of it. A same-group hold is not subtracted - the line holding it
    is in this group's own demand already, and taking it twice would make every pinned
    group read short.

    `group -> position`, negative when the group is short. `POOL_GROUP` carries the site
    pools' own book; a location with no ownership group carries the empty key, and neither
    is a group the ladder may name. The CALLER decides what to do with a negative: this
