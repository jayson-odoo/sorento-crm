"""G12's own count: OPEN project-bin PO/SPO lines nobody has claimed at all
(`PLAN-scm-reorder-oi-feedback-1sep.md` S6, AC-6.11).

Company-wide and always current, never scoped to one upload's own rows: a re-export's
`FromSODocList` notes can resolve a claim onto a line an EARLIER upload wrote, so what
matters to Joey is what remains unclaimed after this pass runs, not what this pass alone
touched. Surfaced on the PO/SPO upload result and as a PO-view filter, so the backfill
has a number to chase to zero rather than a silent gap.

"Claimed" here is the EXACT COMPLEMENT of what the lock opens on (S4, review of PR #490),
and it did not use to be. The count asked "does any claim row name this line", while
`_dedication_for_target` - the lock itself - opens a line only for a claim that is
RESOLVED (it joins through `so_line_id`, so an unresolved claim is invisible to it) and
whose sales order line is still UNSETTLED (a delivered or cancelled order reserves nothing
and dedicates nothing, G7). The two disagreed in exactly the direction that wastes Joey's
time: he chased the count to zero in AutoCount and the lines stayed locked, because the
claims he had written had never resolved onto a sales order this database holds.

So a line counts as CLAIMED here only when a claim names it, that claim has found its
sales-order line, and that line is open. Anything else is what the automatic pass will
still refuse, which is what the number is for.
