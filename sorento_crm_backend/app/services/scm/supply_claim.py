"""Supply this codebase CREATES is born claimed (G12 write-time rule, captain 2 Sep 2026).

`PLAN-scm-reorder-oi-feedback-1sep.md` G12. A PO/SPO line destined for a PROJECT BIN is
auto-taken only by the sales order that claims it, and the claim may never be written by
the pass that wants to consume the line. On real data that hole cost PO 202607-S0067's 114
units of CB1178A-SS-NL at BRW-IB - bought for SO391853 per the AutoCount book - to
SO381895, which self-claimed them and took them.

So attribution arrives from one of three places, and this module is the third:

  1. the BOOK's own `FromSODocList` column (`po_history` / `po_upload` claims);
  2. a PERSON naming the line in the Link dialog (`manual`);
  3. the SUPPLY WRITER, here, at the moment it creates the line.

(3) exists because a purchase order this codebase raises off the reorder plan is not a
speculative buy: the plan row it came from IS the un-linked remainder of the order-inquiry
rows sitting at that `(product, location)` cell, so the buy is FOR those rows and their
sales orders, and the only honest moment to say so is the transaction that opens the line.
One PO line can be born claimed by SEVERAL sales orders - a 114 at BRW-IB sized by SO X (30)
and SO Y (84) writes two claims - which is ordinary G7 sharing, not a special case: a claim
carries no quantity of its own and reserves the claiming SO line's LIVE outstanding.

**PROJECT BINS ONLY.** A pool line is shared supply by definition; claiming one would
reserve capacity against every other order for no reason G12 gives, and G12's own AC-6.10
says a pool-destination line's candidacy is unchanged. `pool_predicate.is_site_pool` is the
one spelling of that test.
