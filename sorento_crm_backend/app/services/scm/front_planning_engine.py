"""Order promising: what covers a Project SO line, and why.

LADDER V7.1 (`PLAN-scm-borrow-ladder-v7-stock-debt.md` section 3.2, rulings R1-R37).

PURE arithmetic, the same discipline as ``coverage_timeline`` and ``supply_assignment``: no
database, no LLM, no optimizer, no configuration knob. Every number here is derived from the
rule that produced it, and every rule states itself in a sentence that travels with the
quantity, because a proposal that shows a number without saying why is a number CS has to go
and verify somewhere else (AC-B14).

Two functions, and they answer two different questions.

``walk_line`` (and ``propose_line``, which is its components alone) answers "how should this
PLANNING UNIT be met" - five steps, in this order, each of them ASKED and answered whether or
not it is taken:

0. beyond the reserve window (``as_of + lead time + RESERVE_BUFFER_DAYS``) or beyond
   purchasing's reorder-coverage date -> no step runs and the whole unit is a ``Buy``;
1. **use** - the asker's own ownership group's FREE pile at its own date (R24), then the
   OTHER project groups' free piles (R5). Free means owed to nobody, so this step raises no
   debt, which is why it is walked before either borrow;
2. **order_borrow** - ON HAND held by a LATER order (R3, R4, R9, R12, R19, R25). The donor
   receives an order-back at its OWN required date, and a decided donor's decision falls
   with it, inside the same Confirm;
3. **supply_borrow** - the SPO a later order is waiting on, ONE document whole
   (R32, R33): eligible when it arrives by the asker's date or before a fresh buy would
   land, and the donor receives an order-back at its own date. Incoming means SPO
   (31 Aug ruling, R-A) - a PO is still ON ORDER, not arriving, and is never offered here;
4. **pool** - the site pools' own book: its free pile, then a later POOL order's on hand,
   which does raise an order-back (R34). The dealer hot-selling gate refuses the whole step;
5. **buy** - the whole unit at ``as_of + lead``.

**A STEP COVERS THE WHOLE UNIT OR IT GIVES NOTHING** (R10, R33). Sources combine INSIDE one
step - two bins of the group, two on-hand donors (R35) - and never across two: half a promise
off the free pile and half off somebody else's order is two different stories about one
delivery, and the captain ruled it out on AC-S4-2b ("the PO is taken whole ... the 16 on hand
stays free").

**Every step is also an OPTION** (R36): the date it would fulfil the unit, how many days late
that is, and whose order pays for it. Five of them travel with every walked unit, in step
order, at most one chosen - the contract is written out in
``fulfilmentPlanningService.ts`` ("LADDER v7.1: THE OPTIONS CONTRACT") and mirrored by
``schemas/project_board.py::BoardLadderOption``.

**What the caller does and this module does not.** Every candidate list arrives already read,
already windowed and already ORDERED (``ProjectSupplyService.use_candidates_for`` /
``order_borrow_candidates_for``, off the ONE ``supply_assignment.assign()`` the Stock Debt
view also reads, R21). This module walks them in the order given and never re-sorts or
re-derives a capacity.

**Incoming is not a step of its own.** An SPO is inside the ownership group's net already -
AutoCount's Available is ``on hand + SPO - SO`` - so step 1 answers with it where it is free
by the asker's date, as ``timely_spo`` rather than as a Reserve, because a hold cannot be
written against goods a picker cannot walk to. A document whose arrival has PASSED with
nothing received is not supply at all until somebody re-dates it (R31).

``attribute_sources`` answers "who gets the one pile" - several lines competing for one
location's opening stock and its dated incoming, resolved in PLAN 3.5's fixed order so the
same facts always produce the same answer and the database's row order never participates.
Untouched by v7.1.

Quantities are ``Decimal`` throughout. These figures are compared for exact equality at
confirmation, and a binary float does not survive that.

    nets -102 and offers NOTHING, where per-pool arithmetic would have offered the 1, which
    is stock the shared book already owes at BRW. `pools` is already in draw order (the

    `free` balance: that is WHERE the quantity can physically come from, and `pools_net` is
    HOW MUCH. Exactly the shape rung 2 has for the ownership group.

    THERE IS NO PER-POOL CAP any more, and 3.3a's project hot-selling gate goes with it:
    that rule capped such a line's draw at the pool's own signed availability, and the

    stock for dealers now is the SHARE (`available_for_project`), a percentage of every pool
    rather than the whole of one for a subset of items. A parameter nothing reads is a rule
    a reader still believes in.

    0. beyond the reserve window, or beyond `reorder_coverage_until` -> no step runs and
       the whole of `open_qty` is a single Buy naming the bound that fired. An UNDATED line
       is never beyond either bound - both comparisons need two dates - so it falls through
       to the full walk;

    0b. **pool_share**: EVERY site pool of the chain (`pools`, in the caller's draw order),
       each under its own project allowance and all of them under the one five-pool net
       (R-A/R-B/R-D/R-N). The one step that may answer with PART of a line, and the one
       asked before the asker's own group;
    1. **use** (`group_take`): the asker's own ownership group's FREE pile at its own date,
       drawn own location first then the siblings by code (`group_take_candidates`, already
       date-aware and already capped by the caller), and then the OTHER project groups'
       free piles (`other_group_candidates`). Free means owed to nobody, so this step
       raises no debt and is walked before either borrow;
    2. **order_borrow**: ON HAND held by a LATER order (`order_borrow_candidates`, already
       windowed and ordered by the caller: same agent, latest date, same group, same
       warehouse). Several donors may combine for one unit (R35). Every take raises an
       order-back at the DONOR's own required date;
    3. **supply_borrow**: the SPO a later order is waiting on (`supply_borrow_candidates`,
       already narrowed by the caller to the ONE document that covers the whole unit,
       R33). Incoming means SPO (31 Aug ruling, R-A) - a PO never reaches this list. A row
       with no donor is free supply and is taken rather than borrowed;
    4. **pool**: a later POOL order's on hand (`pool_borrow_candidates`), which does raise
       an order-back (R34). Reported inside step 0's own row, because it is still the pool
       answering; the free half of that step ran at 0b, before the group;
    5. **buy**: the whole unit.

    **A STEP COVERS THE WHOLE UNIT OR IT GIVES NOTHING** (R10, R33). Sources COMBINE inside
    one step - two bins of the group, two donors of step 2 - and never across two, because
    half a promise from the free pile and half from somebody else's order is two different
    stories about one delivery. The first step that covers the whole of `open_qty` is the
    proposal; if none does, the whole unit is a Buy.

    Each step's inputs are already computed and already ORDERED by the caller; this
    function walks them in the order given and never re-sorts or re-derives a capacity.

    Returns the composition AND the five options (R36): every step with the date it would
    fulfil the unit, how late that is, and whose order pays for it.

    Keyed by each demand line's own ``key`` when it states one, and by
    ``(so_number, line_no)`` when it does not.

    The explicit key is not a convenience. ``line_no`` comes from the PROJECT mirror, and a
    core sales-order line that nobody has adopted has none - so every unmirrored line of one
    sales order collapsed onto the single key ``(so_number, None)``, and all but one of them
    silently received no share at all while the pile was credited as if they had. Invisible on
    the per-order sheet, which only ever walks mirrored lines; fatal to the multi-order board,
    where most lines at a pile belong to orders nobody has adopted.

    Sources are consumed in PLAN 3.5's order - opening stock first, then SPO arriving on or
    before that line's required date - with lines processed by required date, SO number,
    line number (missing last) and finally the internal line id. An SPO arriving ON the
    required date counts; one arriving the day after contributes nothing at that date and
    is advisory evidence instead.

    ``product_code`` names the pile in a failure message and takes no part in the
    arithmetic; the caller has already narrowed the rows to one product and location.
