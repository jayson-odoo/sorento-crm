"""What counts as demand, in one place.

Two books describe the same sales-order line and each owns its own columns:

    qty_ordered, qty_delivered      the sales-order book, what the customer asked for and
                                    what has shipped
    qty_required, purchasing_status the Order Inquiry sheet, what CS decided to cover and
                                    where that stands in purchasing

So the quantity to plan for is the one CS stated, falling back to what is still owed when
nobody has stated one, and always net of what has already shipped:

    GREATEST(COALESCE(qty_required, qty_ordered) - qty_delivered, 0)

`qty_required` is NULL, not zero, when unreviewed. A NULL that fell through to zero would
delete demand nobody has got round to looking at, which is the opposite of what "not
reviewed" means.

This module exists so the netting engine and `scm.committed_v` cannot drift. They are two
implementations of one rule - one in Python over the ORM, one in SQL inside a view - and a
disagreement between them shows up as a dashboard that contradicts a plan run for reasons
nobody can see. The SQL is kept here beside the expression so the next person changing one
finds the other.

#:    location. Nothing else project-class counts."
#:
#: The SALES-ORDER BOOK speaks for the retail side and for nothing else. A project-class
#: line is never demand as a book line - it becomes demand when CS raises an Order Inquiry
#: ORDER row for it, and it stops being demand when that row is linked to a PO or an SPO.
#: One requirement, one place at a time (plan section 1).
#:
#: What this drops is the SHEET leg: an order the old Joey feed stamped
#: `demand_origin = 'scm_order_inquiry'` used to count from the book while nobody had
#: confirmed it on the fulfilment board. M310-CR-PJ showed 16 units of Project demand at
#: BRW-BB on runs b805ba89 / 93305b25 with every one of its inquiry rows already placed,
#: which is that leg and only that leg. Such an order is now AWAITING CS, counted and named
#: by `demand_source_service.set_aside_project_demand`, never netted.
#:
#: The rule is still in TWO halves, and the second one has outlived the first: the
#: line-level `PLAN_DEMAND_LINE_SQL` below says which lines an active decision already
#: covers, which is what the fulfilment board reads as "covered". Every book-demand reader

#:
#: Since P3 (26 Aug 2026) this is no longer part of what the plan counts - the order-level
#: half above excludes project class outright, so there is no sheet quantity left for a
#: decision to displace. What it still answers, and what it is now kept for, is the
#: FULFILMENT BOARD's "covered" flag: a line CS has already decided on, per LINE, so a
#: partially confirmed order shows which of its lines are done and which are not
#: (`project_fulfilment_board_service`).
#:
#: PER LINE, and that is the whole point (PLAN-fulfilment-planning-from-autocount-so.md
#: 13.4). It used to be per ORDER, joining `projects.sales_orders.so_id` to any active
#: decision, which was exact while a confirmation had to cover every line of its order.
#: Partial confirmation ended that.
#:
#: Which lines a decision COVERS is read out of `line_snapshots`, because that JSONB is
#: where it is recorded: one object per covered line, each carrying its `core_line_id`
#: (`ProjectSupplyService._snapshot`). No new table, no new column - 13.4's open
#: sub-question, answered by measuring the lateral rather than by adding a link table.
#: The match is on the core sales-order line id and never on a reference, a document

#: `committed` stays the sum of the three new columns, so `scm.net_position_v` and every
#: consumer of it sees no change. What is new is that the row can now SAY which channel its
#: commitment came from, which is what makes a Project total firm and a Retail total
#: nettable without a second read model.
#:
#: Project demand has ONE source: `projects.order_inquiry_rows` (P3, captain 26 Aug 2026).
#: Two legs read it, and they are disjoint by construction:
#:
#: * the CONFIRMED leg - current un-linked Buy on a row pointing at an ACTIVE
#:   `projects.so_supply_decisions` row, landed at the location of the reconciled core SO
#:   line (the DONOR's location for an ORDER BACK).
#: * the FORM leg - a row the CS Order Inquiry Form raised that the sales-order book carries
#:   no line for, landed at the item code and stock location the ROW itself states.
#:
#: The SHEET leg is GONE. It counted an open line of a `demand_origin = 'scm_order_inquiry'`
#: order while no active decision covered that line, which is how M310-CR-PJ read 16 units of
#: Project demand at BRW-BB (SO394803 line 10 + SO411133 line 6) with every one of its
#: inquiry rows already placed, and how MSK11B read 243 at BRW-IB off SO409325. Those orders
#: came in through the old sheet feed months ago and nobody has confirmed them on the
#: fulfilment board - so they are AWAITING CS, not demand, and
#: `demand_source_service.set_aside_project_demand` is where they are counted and named.
#:
#: With the sheet leg gone the BOOK leg speaks for the retail side alone, so `project_qty`
#: and `project_confirmed_qty` are always equal (`project_committed` IS the confirmed
#: figure) and the old `decided` CTE has nothing left to exclude.
#:
#: Every constant leg column is `0::numeric`, and the cast is LOAD-BEARING. Postgres types a
#: bare `0` as integer, `SUM(integer)` comes out bigint, and `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` refuses
#: to change an existing column's type: applying this over a database already carrying the
#: view dies with `cannot change data type of view column "unclassified_committed" from
#: numeric to bigint`. It did, on the dev copy. The bodies before P3 never hit it because
#: their zeros sat in a `CASE` whose other arm was numeric, which coerced them; a whole
#: column of bare zeros has nothing to be coerced by.
#:
#: `unclassified_qty` is a CONSTANT ZERO, not a leg (P4). Nothing is unclassified any more:
#: migration 425 stamped every NULL `demand_class` retail and the SO import now refuses a
#: file that would create another, so a NULL class here reads as retail - the book-direct
#: channel - instead of as a fourth column nobody can act on. The COLUMN survives because
#: `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` may only append columns, never drop one, and dropping it would
#: mean dropping and rebuilding `scm.net_position_v` and everything under it for a figure
#: that is now always 0.
#: What the sales order line still OWES, in SQL, over the alias `sol` every project leg

#: legs (PLAN-reorder-plan-demand-class-orders.md, S2, 21 Sep 2026). Walks an inquiry row
#: back to its own CORE sales order - `order_inquiry_id -> order_inquiries.
#: project_sales_order_id -> projects.sales_orders.so_id -> sales_orders.id` - and matches
#: its number against the bound list. R1: the key is the WHOLE SO, intersected with every
#: other predicate already on the leg (a row outside the range or unacknowledged is still
#: excluded even when its SO is named). Never applied to the retail leg: an SO scope only
#: ever narrows the project leg. `sso.company_id = oir.company_id` (security N1, 21 Sep
#: 2026): a bare `so_number` match would let a same-numbered SO in ANOTHER company match
#: this row - SO numbers are unique per company, not globally.

    """THE PLAN'S committed figure: `COMMITTED_V_SQL`'s body as a bare SELECT (no
    `CREATE VIEW`), with a `:horizon` bind narrowing both legs to demand due at or before
    it, a `:horizon_start` bind (S4, PLAN-reorder-feedback-9sep.md) narrowing them to demand
    due at or after it, and with the project legs narrowed to ACKNOWLEDGED demand.

    Planning horizon (captain, 20 Aug): "SOs needed in 2030" a buyer never asked about
    should not distort a plan they only want through December. `scm.committed_v` itself
    is untouched and every OTHER reader (the demand-drill popover, the dashboard, the
    coverage timeline) keeps reading it unfiltered - this is used ONLY by
    `reorder_run_service._planning_rows`, to give a plan run its own committed figure.

    The acknowledgement rule (captain, 27 Aug, `PLAN-scm-oi-handshake.md`) is why this is
    now read on EVERY run rather than only on a horizoned one: an order-inquiry row
    purchasing has not acknowledged yet is not something to buy against - CS may still
    amend it and purchasing may still refuse it - so the two project legs count
    `PLANNED_ACK_STATES` alone. The view goes on counting an awaiting row, because it is
    still owed to the customer; what the plan page shows for the difference is the
    "N awaiting acknowledgement" chip, never a purchase.

    A NULL `:horizon` (or `:horizon_start`) reproduces `scm.committed_v`'s DATE handling
    exactly: every date comparison short-circuits true, so an unhorizoned run (the daily
    scheduled one, and any manual run that leaves the field empty) nets as it always did
    except for the acknowledgement rule above. Demand carrying NO date at all is always
    counted, whatever either bind is - unscheduled demand is still demand, not a reason to
    guess it is late or early (G2, 9 Sep ruling).

    Kept beside `COMMITTED_V_SQL` rather than derived from it: the view body is frozen
    for the migration/downgrade pair (`test_committed_v_migration_chain.py`) and must
    stay copy-pasteable, so this is a second copy of the same `legs` shape with one
    predicate added to each leg - the same relationship `COMMITTED_V_SQL` already has to
    the individual predicates in this module (`PLAN_DEMAND_ORDER_SQL` etc).

    ``demand_class`` (PLAN-reorder-plan-demand-class-orders.md, S2, 21 Sep 2026) drops
    whichever legs the run's Demand scope excludes from the UNION: ``'project'`` keeps only
    the two project legs (confirmed + form), ``'retail'`` keeps only the book leg, and
    ``None`` - every caller before this lane, and an unscoped run - keeps all three,
    rendering the exact SQL this function has always produced (T12).

    ``so_scoped`` (same plan) adds `_SO_SCOPE_JOIN_SQL` to BOTH project legs when True,
    narrowing them to the sales orders bound as `:so_numbers` (R1: the key is the whole
    SO, intersected with every predicate already on the leg - a row outside the range or
    unacknowledged is still excluded even when its SO is named). False (the default) adds
    no join and binds no `:so_numbers`, so a caller that never asks for this - every OTHER
    caller of this function today - keeps compiling/binding exactly as it always has.

    """WHEN the project quantity `horizon_committed_select_sql` counts is owed, per product.

    The DATE companion of that function's two project legs, and a companion is the point: a
    date read under looser conditions than the quantity describes need the plan is not
    planning for. That is what it did - the date came off `summary_order_service`, whose own
    rule is the Order Summary's (`state = 'raised'` alone, no remainder test, no horizon), so
    a row already placed on a purchase order could still make a product rank as urgent.

    So the predicates below are the project legs' own, condition for condition: the ACTIVE
    decision, `verb IN ('ORDER','ORDER_BACK')`, `state IN ('raised','partly_linked')`, the
    un-linked remainder `oir.qty > COALESCE(linked, 0)`, the form leg's `supply_decision_id
    IS NULL` and its retail-shadow `NOT EXISTS`, and the same `:horizon` bind in each. A row
    the quantity leg excludes contributes no date, and a row it counts contributes its own.

    A THIRD copy of the leg shape, and it lives here for the reason the second one does (see
    `horizon_committed_select_sql`): `COMMITTED_V_SQL` is frozen for the migration/downgrade
    pair and must stay copy-pasteable, so the variants sit beside it where the next person
    changing one finds the others.

    The confirmed leg dates off the inquiry row and falls back to the reconciled core line's
    required date, which is the rule the Order Summary established and the only one the two
    documents can both answer. `MIN` over an all-NULL group is NULL and is dropped: a Buy
    nobody has dated contributes no date at all, rather than a guess.

    copy carry no supply decision (the CS form leg, never confirmed on the fulfilment
    board) and never reached the sheet.

    ``so_numbers`` (non-``None``) narrows to the CORE sales order's own `so_number` -
    deliberately the SAME column `reorder_run_service._planning_rows` /
    `demand.horizon_committed_select_sql(so_scoped=True)` bind `:so_numbers` against
    (`_SO_SCOPE_JOIN_SQL` above), not `order_inquiry_worklist_service._SO_NUMBER`'s
    `COALESCE(autocount_doc_no, provisional_ref)` - that coalesce is a DISPLAY label for a
    project SO that may never have been adopted, while the run's own `so_numbers` are
    picked off the candidate-orders endpoint, which lists the CORE `sales_orders.so_number`
    (`reorder_runs.get_candidate_orders`). Matching on the display label here would silently
    stop matching an adopted order the moment its provisional ref differs from its
    AutoCount doc number. ``None`` applies no filter at all (every product-scoped row is in
    scope); an empty list matches nothing (`= ANY('{}')`), which is "Project scoped, buyer
    picked no orders" (`reorder_run_service.create_run`'s own `stored_so_numbers = []`).

    ``horizon_start``/``horizon`` narrow to `delivery_date` inside `[horizon_start,
    horizon]`; a row with no delivery date is always in scope, whatever either bound is -
    the same "undated is always in" rule `horizon_committed_select_sql` applies to the
    book leg.

    Raw SQL, company-scoped by hand on the core sales order (`company_sql_predicate`) -
    `OrderInquiryRow` is company-scoped but a raw `text()` bypasses the ORM's own isolation
