"""SCM purchase-order service - list/read + the M4 Slice B draft→confirm→GR flow.

The PO is the inbound-supply record feeding on-order / incoming into the net
position views. M1 was read-only; M4 Slice B adds:

  * ``bulk_confirm`` - flips ``draft_recommendation`` → ``active`` and assigns the
    CANONICAL ``PO-{year}/{month:02d}-####`` number via the shared ``NumberingService``
    (the same rule that stamps SO/PO numbers, mig 274). Only then does the PO count as
    on-order (``scm.on_order_v`` - M4-D5/D6). Idempotent: non-draft ids are skipped.
  * ``create_gr`` - creates a goods receipt (``picking_headers`` /
    ``picking_lines`` with ``picking_type='goods_received'``) from an active/partial PO,
    stamping ``qty_received`` onto the PO lines (M4-D6).

po_number + supplier / warehouse codes are surfaced (never UUIDs).

        """Confirm draft POs -> active + canonical number (M4-D6). Idempotent: a PO not
        in ``draft_recommendation`` is skipped, so re-confirming is a no-op.

        Confirming is also one of the moments the order-inquiry auto-place cascade
        runs (captain, 21 Aug): a line an internal draft PO just opened may already
        have a RAISED buy row waiting on exactly this product, so placement should not
        wait on someone clicking a separate button - the same idempotent cascade
        ``project_supply_service.auto_place_for_confirmed_products`` runs on a decision
        confirm, a THIRD trigger of it rather than a mirror of that function's own
        shape: it runs a SAVEPOINT (``begin_nested``) inside the SAME transaction as
        its caller's writes, because that caller has not committed yet; this one runs
        commit-then-try, its own separate best-effort transaction AFTER the confirm's
        own commit, because the confirm here already IS the commit point - the confirm
        itself has already succeeded by the time this runs, so a failure here must not
        turn that success into a 500 the retry cannot repair (CLAUDE.md - post-commit
        side effects are best-effort, never raise).

        The cascade runs in TWO passes (P7, captain 26 Aug 2026). A purchase order raised
        off the plan is a buy for particular plan ROWS, and a plan row is a
        `(product, location)` cell whose Project figure is the un-linked remainder of the
        inquiry rows sitting at it. Pass one names exactly those rows
        (``rows_needed_at``), so the confirm links back to the rows that asked for it; pass
        two is the ordinary product-wide cascade, which finishes anything left over. Before
        this, one pass walked the earliest open row by expected date, so a confirm could
        satisfy a row at the other end of the country while the row that sized the buy
        stayed raised and the PO's "Allocated to" panel named a stranger.

        ``actor`` (a real user id) is REQUIRED for the auto-place pass, never
        substituted: ``OrderInquiryRow.actioned_by`` is a genuine FK to ``users.id``,
        so a placeholder like ``"system"`` would violate the constraint, the
        IntegrityError would be swallowed by the very try/except that makes this
        best-effort, and the whole placement batch would silently roll back (code

        `PLAN-scm-oi-handshake.md` section 11. A confirm has nobody to ask for a date, so
        it takes the one the buy was sized under - and it has to say WHICH of the three
        answers that is, not just hand on a date (item 1, re-review 27 Aug 2026):

          drafted off a run that named a horizon -> that date (`"date"`)
          drafted off a run that named NONE      -> no horizon at all (`"none"`)
          drafted off no single run              -> the plan in force (`"plan"`)

        The middle arm is the one this got wrong. `plan_link_horizon` answers `None` for a
        run that planned every open line, a bare `None` on the wire is indistinguishable
        from "this caller named nothing", and the cascade resolves THAT by reaching for the
        latest completed run. The daily scheduled run names no horizon
        (`task_scheduler.py`), so every purchase order drafted off it was linked under
        whatever date somebody's last manual run happened to plan to. A run's silence is an
        answer: it planned everything, so nothing is held back.

        The last arm is the plan in force, which is right for a purchase order somebody
        keyed by hand, and is also what a purchase order drafted off TWO runs gets - see
        `_plan_run_for_source_refs`. Never the newest run for one drafted off a single
        older one: a draft may sit for days while a later run plans further out, and
        linking under THAT horizon would hand the buy to rows the run that ordered it
        never counted.
