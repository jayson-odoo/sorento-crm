"""ONE spelling of "this bin takes part in fulfilment planning", for every reader of it.

**The rule.** A warehouse is IN fulfilment planning when it is ACTIVE and its
`fulfilment_planning` flag is true. Nothing else: not the code's suffix, not the segment,
not `counts_as_available`. Migration 443 seeds the flag from the client's own group
convention once, and from then on it is configuration an admin edits on the Warehouses
screen - deriving it at runtime would bake one client's naming into the engine, which is
the mistake `pool_warehouse_id` and `segment` were both stored to avoid.

**What being OFF means.** Everything (R17). A bin that is off contributes no on hand, no
incoming and no sales-order line to the ladder, the fulfilment board, the donor lists or
the Stock Debt view. That is stronger than `counts_as_available`, where the stock is merely
not sellable while the location's demand still counts against the group; here the location
is not part of the question at all.

**What being OFF does NOT change: what a location HOLDS.** `free_stock_by_location`,
`stock_levels_by_location` and `held_stock_by_location` are the public stock seams the
board's stock detail and the location-stock screen print, and they answer for every ACTIVE
bin. A bin nobody plans against still holds its stock, and 1,928 on hand printed beside 0
free reads as a defect rather than as a policy. The narrowing belongs to what a proposal
may DRAW (`project_supply_service._drawable_free_stock`) and to what the ownership groups
NET, never to the figures a screen states.

**Why one module.** The same test is applied by `project_supply_service`
(`_planning_warehouses`, the group siblings, the cross-group donor walk), by the ownership
group index it hands `group_netting`, and by the board (its group index and its demand
rows). Four files agreeing by hand is a rule that holds until one of them is edited - the
exact reasoning `pool_predicate.py` records for the site-pool test, and it is this module's
whole justification.

**Site pools are OFF, and that is not a bug.** A pool is reached through
`pool_warehouse_id`, never as an ownership group, so the pool rung reads its own set
(`project_supply_service._site_pool_warehouses`) and is unaffected by this predicate.
Anything that nets the two together has to union the two sets explicitly, which is what
`_pile_facts` does.
