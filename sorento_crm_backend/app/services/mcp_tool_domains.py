"""Tool -> chatbot domain mapping, as plain data, for services OUTSIDE the chatbot
package boundary (AC-002, `tests/chatbot/test_import_boundary.py`).

D15 first put this fact on `app.services.chatbot.contracts.DOMAIN_SPEC[domain].tools`
and had `mcp_tool_registry_service.sync_catalog` invert it directly - which is core
importing the chatbot package, the one direction AC-002 forbids (D17, CI run on
bf8814585). This module is the fix: the mapping lives here, in `app/services/`, so
`sync_catalog` (and any other core service) can read it with no import across the
boundary.

**Nothing READS the stamped column today (8 Sep 2026).** Its one reader was the
chatbot's tool search, and that search is gone: the business lane picks
`contracts.DOMAIN_SPEC[domain].tools[0]` outright. Both the column and this mapping
stay because dropping them is a migration on a column production never populated, and
that is a follow-up with its own trigger (the next migration that touches
`mcp_tools`), not a reason to churn the table now.

`contracts.DOMAIN_SPEC[domain].tools` stays the hand-authored, richly-commented
version the chatbot module itself reads (`CHATBOT_READ_ONLY_TOOLS`, the fetch lane's
per-tool tables) - moving those tuples here would strand the per-tool reasoning
comments they carry (e.g. why `crm_order_analytics` is excluded from `order`) next to
a flat dict that has no room for them. Chosen over deriving `DOMAIN_SPEC.tools` from
this module because that is the smaller diff and loses nothing: this module's own
data is dumb by design, so nothing here needs the prose contracts.py already carries.
`tests/chatbot/test_domain_spec.py` is the guardrail that keeps the two from
drifting - one runtime fact, told twice, checked never to disagree.
