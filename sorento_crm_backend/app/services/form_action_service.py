        The sweep and the lazy-commit-on-read can both reach the same row. A
        conditional UPDATE with a rowcount check is what makes the loser a no-op -
        checking `row.status` in Python would let both pass (AC-D-6).

        The handler is resolved BEFORE the row is claimed, deliberately. Two
        processes can share this table without sharing a registry - every dev
        worktree points at one Postgres, and a rolling deploy briefly runs two
        versions - so a process that has never heard of `row.action_key` must
        leave the row exactly as it found it (PENDING) rather than claim it and
        then fail to run it: claiming first stamps `status=COMMITTED` while
        nothing has actually happened, and that status permanently stops any
        other sweep from ever looking at the row again - a silent, unrecoverable
        no-op the frontend reports as success (traced live: a folder's `Set
        company -> Shared` read `committed` with the folder never touched).

        The claim UPDATE is then deliberately left UNCOMMITTED: Postgres holds
        the row lock from the moment the statement runs, not from commit, so a
        concurrent claim attempt already blocks on it and re-reads `pending` as
        `committed` once we finally commit - AC-D-6 needs no commit of its own to
        hold. Committing the claim early used to stamp `status=committed` durable
        BEFORE the handler had written anything: a process that died between that
        commit and the handler's (a `--reload` restart mid-request, a SIGKILL) left
        the row reading `committed`, no `error_text`, with the domain mutation
        never applied - and nothing ever retries a row that already reads
        `committed`. Leaving the claim uncommitted folds it into the SAME
        transaction as the handler's own commit (or `_execute`'s rollback-then-
        refail on an exception): either both land, or neither does, and a crash
        before either leaves the row `pending` for the next sweep to pick up.

        The two rules cover different failure modes and both are load-bearing: the
        first stops a row being claimed by a process that cannot run it at all, the
        second stops a claimed row being stamped done before its work is durable.
