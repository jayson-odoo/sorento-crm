"""A product code, then words that pick among its variants.

Owner hand test of rounds 4 to 6 on PR #833 (27 Sep 2026, items 2 to 4). A salesperson
types the code she knows and the variant she wants in plain words: "I need srtwc8840 s
trap bowl only price", "Srtwc8840 bowl only price", "Srtwc7604 p trap price". The code
names a family (SRTWC8840-SC, SRTWC8840-LID and the X-prefixed bowls SRTWCX8840-P and
SRTWCX8840-S); the words after it pick the variant. Before this, the words either opened a
category set of unrelated S trap water closets, were ignored, or were folded into the code
("Srtwc7604ptrap") so that nothing matched.

The rule, in order:
  1. A token is a code token when a word of the message is letters then digits and the
     token starts with it (the lane folds "Srtwc7604 p trap" into one token, so the word
     is read back off the message).
  2. The family is every active product whose code, with separators removed, starts with
     that word, or with the same word with an "X" after its letters (SRTWC7604 and
     SRTWCX7604), and does not go on with another digit (8840 is not 88401).
  3. The other words of the message are matched against each variant's code, name,
     description and spec values: first two-word phrases ("p trap", "seat cover"), then
     single words of three letters or more. A word no variant carries ("price", "need",
     "eta") picks nothing and is ignored.
  4. The variants carrying every matched phrase are the answer. When no variant carries
     all of them, the ones carrying the most are ("Did you mean" prefers the variants
     that match what was said). When nothing was matched, or every variant carries it,
     the family is left alone.

The answer replaces the code token with the variants' own codes, which the resolver then
matches exactly, so a code ask never becomes a described set.
