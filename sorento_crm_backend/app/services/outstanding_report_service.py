DO line for the product) - every total, breakdown group and row list below is
rolled up from those two result sets in Python, so "Ordered = Transferred +
Outstanding" (SO) and "DO qty = Delivered + Pending" (DO) are ARITHMETIC over
the SAME population, never two queries that could silently drift apart (the
defect this route replaces - see the plan's "Why", items 1 and 3).

    `pending_qty` is what is still outstanding on them, `delivered_qty` is the difference
    (the part-delivered portion, 0 while a DO is outstanding as a whole), the date range
    spans them, the breakdowns name them and the detail list is them.

    So every number tallies with every other by construction: the breakdown quantities
    sum to the block's, the brackets sum to its Outstanding, and a fully delivered DO
    appears nowhere - not as a total, not as a name with `(O/S: 0)` beside it, not as a
    row. R6's two-population block (totals over every DO, count over the outstanding
    ones) is what made the breakdown disagree with the summary above it.
