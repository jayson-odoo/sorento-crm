"""Make the class and brand encoded in `category_code` machine-readable.

`product_categories.category_name` is a verbatim copy of `category_code` on all 175
live rows, so the two most valuable ranking signals in the catalog are sitting in a
string nothing reads. The codes decompose as `<BRAND>-<CLASS>`:

    SRT-KS  ->  Sorento  Kitchen Sink
    CB-FT   ->  Cabana   Tap and Fitting
    BRT-WC  ->  Bravat   Water Closet

Class matters more than any other spec key because its coverage is total: every
product has a category, whereas `dimensions_length` is populated on 14.6% of rows and
`item_type` on none. It is therefore the largest single boost in the spec-search
ranker, which is also why an unmapped code must never be guessed at: a wrong class is
the most damaging value the ranker can be handed.

Scope is deliberately the pilot class only (jayson-odoo/sorento-crm#72, the T0 tracer).
Widening is adding entries to `CLASS_SUFFIXES`, not changing this module.
