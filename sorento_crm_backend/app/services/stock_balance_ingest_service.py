"""Ingest AutoCount stock balance pushes (contract 2.5, Foundryx SR5).

PLAN: `documentation/plans/autocount/PLAN-ingest-stock-balances-2-5.md` D1-D11.
UAC:  `documentation/plans/autocount/ingest-stock-balances-2-5-acceptance-criteria.md`.

`stock_balances` is not a master, a document or a shipping order - it never
back-creates, never adopts, never touches `integration_references` at all
(D3: `source_ref` is an echo key only, never stored). Its identity is the
(product, warehouse) pair, resolved fresh on every push - a small enough shape
that it gets its own service rather than another branch inside
`MasterIngestService`, which the module docstring there says is already
carrying three different fused semantics.

**Same envelope, different resolution.** `ingest()` returns the exact same
`IngestResult`/`RecordResult` dataclasses `MasterIngestService` does, so the
wire shape at `/external/ingest/stock_balances` is byte-identical in kind to
every other entity on this surface - only the resolution ladder underneath is
new. `delete()` does the same with `deletion_service`'s `DeletionResult`/
`DeletionRecordResult`.

**Only `quantity_on_hand` is ever written.** `reserved`, `damaged`,
`reorder_point` and `zone_id` are set by the CRM side (manual counts, picks,
zoning) and AutoCount has no opinion on any of them - D4's upsert touches one
column, full stop, on both a create (the model's own defaults handle the
rest) and an update (every other column is left exactly as it was).

**A deletion zeroes, it never removes.** D7: AutoCount deleting a stock
balance means "this pair no longer holds any quantity", not "forget this
pair ever existed" - the row (and whatever ledger/audit history points at
it) stays, at zero.

**Warehouse resolution never raises.** Unlike a product miss (retryable -
the row may simply not have synced yet), an unresolved or inactive warehouse
is `updated` with a fixed warning and nothing written - the same shape
`MasterRefResolver` already gives warehouses on every other ingest surface,
reused here via `WARN_WAREHOUSE_UNRESOLVED`.

**One preload per batch, plain dicts.** `_build_preload` reads every
warehouse of the anchor company, every product whose code the batch actually
names, and every stock row for those products - once, before the per-record
loop, the same "avoid the N+1" reasoning `MasterIngestService`'s own
`_ProductBatchPreload` documents at length, but as three bare dicts on
`self` rather than a second class: this service has one preload shape, not
several. A record's own write updates `self._stock_by_pair` in place, so a
duplicate pair later in the SAME batch sees it (AC-SB-13); a record whose
savepoint rolls back removes whatever IT added via `self._pending_stock_keys`,
the same revert-on-rollback shape `_pending_preload_additions` gives that
other preload.

**Exact code match wins; more than one normalised match is ambiguous.**
`warehouse_code`/`product_code` are unique per company only as the RAW stored
string (migration 305) - two rows spelled `"MBS"` and `"mbs "` can coexist.
An incoming code matching one of them exactly (after the pydantic layer's own
trim) is resolved to that row without further question; failing that, more
than one row sharing its case/whitespace-insensitive form cannot be told
apart and the record is refused rather than guessed at.

**A same-pair insert race is a conflict, not a retry loop.** Two pushes for
the same never-before-seen pair, close enough together, can both find no
existing row and both attempt the same INSERT - the DB's own
`uq_stock_product_id_warehouse_id` index catches the loser. The loser
re-reads (company-scoped) and switches to an UPDATE, so the last value still
wins; a row that STILL cannot be found company-scoped despite the conflict
means the pair's id pair already belongs to a different company (that
constraint carries no company column of its own), a data defect refused as
`failed` rather than silently adopted.
