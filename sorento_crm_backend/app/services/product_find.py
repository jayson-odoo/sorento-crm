"""Generic product find: ONE read (`crm_find`) whose filters live in a registry (CHAT-FIND).

Architecture option D, "reads generic, actions specific"
(`documentation/plans/chatbot/ARCH-scalable-chat-11oct.html`, PR #1566). A new question type
is one `FindFilter` row here plus eval cases: the parser learns it through the live
`{{find_filters}}` prompt variable (`parser_vocabulary`), the reply through `labels` (merged
into `chatbot/label_catalog.LABELS` for ms / zh), and the route / MCP tool / lane never change.

What a filter takes (declared on its row, checked by the route, never by the lane):

* products (`products=True`, type `product_ref`): the resolved products the message names (the
  chatbot's resolver fills `product_ids`; the model never invents an id);
* a value (`value=ValueSpec(...)`): `code` (a code-shaped string), `number` (finite, with a unit
  from the row's `units`) or `enum` (one of the row's `values`, a tuple or read from the
  database); the parser emits it as `value` + `unit`.

A row may take both. Its runner gets one `FilterArg(product_ids, value, unit)` and answers groups
(one per named product, or one group with no anchor), so a spec or promotion row (#1582) moves
in with no branch in the route, the lane or the MCP tool.

First filter, `fits` (owner request 13 Oct; card `CARD-chat-generic-find-12oct.md`): the WC
<-> seat cover links of PR #1590 (`product_compatibility`). The direction comes from the data
(card Q1 a): a product on the WC end of a link lists its seat covers, one on the seat cover
end the WCs it fits. Only links on record are answered; nothing is inferred (owner ruling 12
Oct). Company and brand scope apply through the ORM listener, as on every product read.

Stock (card Q2 a) is read through `StockService.list_stock` with the asking contact, so the
contact's stock-visibility policy decides the shape: a number for detailed / compact, the
availability verdict for 1 unit (never a number of ours) for a dealer.

Plan: `documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-chat-generic-find-12oct.md`.
