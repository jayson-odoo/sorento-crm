"""Apply a customer (debtor) listing to `customers`.

Three decisions carry this file, all from UAC-customer-importer.

**The key is (company, code).** CUSTOMER-CODE-IDENTITY (owner decision 30 Sep 2026,
superseding AC-1's pair rule): the debtor code is the customer, mirroring the live index
`uq_customers_company_code_lower` exactly, `lower(btrim(...))` included, or "new" and
"already exists" disagree and the insert takes a 23505. The listing is AutoCount's debtor
master, so a changed name on a known code is a RENAME of that row; the name it replaces is
kept on the row as an alias (`customer_rules.record_name_alias`), and the same code twice in
one file is the same customer stated twice (the first row wins).

**What a person curates is never overwritten.** Account owners, notes and the active flag are
untouched by any re-import; the market segment is filled when blank and never replaced,
because it decides SCM demand class and a silent change re-prioritises live orders. A blank
cell means "not supplied", never "clear the field" (AC-3). `customer_type` is set on insert
and never moved after: it is the discriminator the app branches on, and a debtor listing's
`Debtor Type` column speaks a different vocabulary (Trade / Cash / Local).

**Company comes from the job's scope, never from the file.** Every write goes through the ORM
so `CompanyScopedMixin`'s `before_insert` stamps it and scoped reads isolate. Raw SQL here
would bypass the stamp and the row would either violate the NOT NULL or land invisible to
every scoped read, which presents as "the import silently did nothing" (AC-2).

**What the preview promises, the import keeps.** Both run through `_run`, and the one check
that reads the schema - the over-length pre-check - reads it from the DATABASE, once per
import (`column_limits`), not from the model. It read the model until a real 4,196-row export
met a `phone_number` column the model called String(50) and Postgres called `varchar(20)`: 58
rows passed a preview promising 0 failures and were then refused at apply time. Migration 355
realigned the two and `tests/test_customers_schema_drift.py` fails on the next divergence,
but sourcing the check from the schema is what makes a future drift an honest preview rather
than a surprise (AC-7).
