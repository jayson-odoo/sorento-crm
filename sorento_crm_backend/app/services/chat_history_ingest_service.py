"""The one row writer every mirror lane uses (lane CHAT-LOCAL-FIRST, R3).

Three lanes now write a Respond message into ``chat_histories`` as it happens: n8n
(``POST /api/v1/external/chat-history/messages``), Respond.io's own webhook
(``POST /api/v1/public/respond/webhook``) and the CRM's own send mirror. The first
two land here, so the dedupe, the fill-if-null merge and the post-commit announce
(event bus poke, phone push) are one implementation - a second copy of the ON
CONFLICT clause is how a dedupe silently stops working.

``upsert_message_row`` commits. ``announce_new_row`` runs AFTER that commit and never
raises: a post-commit side effect that fails must not turn a stored message into a
500 that makes the caller retry the lane this endpoint exists to end.

# webhook lane and Respond's own outgoing-message trigger), and with the direct
# webhook a WhatsApp message reaches it from two feeds, so the same message must
# resolve to one row whichever lane wins the race. The conflict target is the partial
# unique index from migration 326; its predicate is repeated verbatim because Postgres
# infers the arbiter index from it (CHAT_HISTORY_DEDUPE_PREDICATE). Rows with no
# message_id are outside the index and keep inserting exactly as before.
#
# DO UPDATE, not DO NOTHING: DO NOTHING returns no row (so the caller could not be
# told which row its message is), and the losing lane often carries context the
# winner lacked (turn_id, the quoted message, the attachment). Fill-if-null only: a
# mirror re-states a message, it never edits it.
