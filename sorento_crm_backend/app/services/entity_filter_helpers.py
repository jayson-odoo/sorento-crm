"""Per-resource `entities` plumbing.

Shared helper so each service that supports the `entities: list[str]` parameter
doesn't have to re-implement the same boilerplate (resolve, empty-guard, echo
payload). Each call site supplies:

    1. The free-text `entities` list.
    2. A `primary_bucket` callable that returns the bucket field whose presence
       gates whether the listing has anything to filter on (e.g. product_codes
       for stock balance / products list; shipment_numbers for incoming-stock
       shipments). If that bucket is empty after resolution, the helper builds
       an empty-list payload + echo so the caller can early-return.
    3. The allowed entity types for the resource.

Usage pattern:

    buckets = resolve_or_empty(db, entities, allowed_entity_types=(...))
    if buckets is not None and not buckets.product_codes:
        return empty_payload(buckets, page=page, limit=limit)
    # ... apply filter ...
    return attach_echo(payload, buckets)
