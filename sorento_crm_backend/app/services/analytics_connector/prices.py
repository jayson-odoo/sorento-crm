"""Model prices for the connector's cost datasets (CHAT-TURN-COST, `documentation/plans/analytics/PLAN-chat-turn-cost-13oct.md`).

`llm_model_prices` is the one place a price lives; the views join it, so a price edit is a row
update and no query changes. Only prices the owner confirmed are seeded. Every other model stays
unpriced (cost NULL) until the owner adds its row: a guessed price would read as a fact. That
includes `gpt-4o-transcribe`, which is billed per audio minute and does not fit a per-token row.

Adding or changing a price is one statement (USD per 1M tokens, cached NULL when unknown):

    INSERT INTO llm_model_prices (model, input_usd_per_1m, cached_input_usd_per_1m, output_usd_per_1m, note)
    VALUES ('<exact model id from the usage log>', <input>, <cached input or NULL>, <output>, 'owner, <date>')
    ON CONFLICT (model) DO UPDATE SET input_usd_per_1m = EXCLUDED.input_usd_per_1m,
        cached_input_usd_per_1m = EXCLUDED.cached_input_usd_per_1m,
        output_usd_per_1m = EXCLUDED.output_usd_per_1m, note = EXCLUDED.note, updated_at = now();
