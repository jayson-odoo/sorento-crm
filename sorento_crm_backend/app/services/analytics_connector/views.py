"""The `analytics_connector` schema: read-only views over the chat tables (card section 5.2).

One source for the view bodies. The migration `acc_0001_connector` calls `ensure_views`, and
`scripts/bootstrap_env.py` calls it too (a bootstrapped database never runs migration bodies).
A later change to a view means a new migration that calls `ensure_views` again.

Times are Malaysia wall clock. OTP sign-in codes are masked here with the same pattern as
`app.services.otp_redaction.OTP_TEXT_RE`; a test feeds both the same fixtures. No view carries
a phone number (except `turn_costs.contact_phone`, owner ruling 13 Oct), `session_vars`, `portal_slug`, a turn `envelope`/`trace`/`response` blob, or
`chat_histories.result`/`state_trace`.

The two cost views (`llm_calls`, `turn_costs`) are created by ``ensure_cost_views``.
