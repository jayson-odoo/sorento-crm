"""Registry of every email event the system can emit.

Adding a new event = add a row here. `seed_event_configs` upserts into
`email_event_configs` on startup so the admin UI lists it immediately.

Each row gives operators:
- a per-event enable/disable switch (`enabled`)
- optional rate / window overrides
- optional coalesce window (collapses bursts to one email per recipient)
