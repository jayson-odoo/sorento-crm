"""What a product set costs.

The price is DERIVED, never stored. Sorento's catalogue parks the whole set's
list price on one member - `SRTWCX8608-RL` the pedestal reads 1180.00 while
`SRTWCY8608` the cistern reads 0.00 - so the set price is a sum over whichever
members are ticked, not a sum over all of them and not a number typed twice.

Deriving it at read time is the point: a member's price changes and the set
follows with no backfill and no second source of truth to drift.

An absent price is not zero. A set with nothing ticked, or with no members yet,
returns `None` and a reason. The dealer-kit pricing work already paid for this
lesson - a list price of zero is missing data, not a free product - and a set
mid-authoring that claims "RM 0.00" is worse than one that says it has no basis.

UAC group D. Plan: `documentation/plans/master-data/PLAN-product-sets.md`.

Not to be confused with `product_predicate_service.py`, which filters products by
spec predicate for the chatbot's backward search. That module used to hold this
name.
