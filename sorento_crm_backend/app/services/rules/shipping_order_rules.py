    S4 (security review): a dependant's own `company_id` is NULLABLE on both

    lost pairing - `ck_order_inquiry_links_one_target` requires exactly one of
    its two targets to be set, so the FK's own `SET NULL` on the delete
    violates the CHECK and fails the whole push.

    `company_id` is REQUIRED (AC-X31, D30a): the whole point of the widened
    read is that the ambient filter is switched off for it, so the caller's
    own anchor is the ONLY thing left narrowing the write. A default would
    make "every company" reachable by forgetting one keyword.

      just the anchor: a foreign pick hanging off a row about to be zeroed is exactly
      the receipt this guard exists to protect, and the read returns a number only,
      so failing closed on it exposes nothing (security review S2).

    Any failure raises, and the document's own savepoint (ingest) or rollback
    (repair script) leaves it exactly as it was.
