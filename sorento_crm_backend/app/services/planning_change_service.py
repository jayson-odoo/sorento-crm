"""The SO book's own reaction to the plan (`documentation/plans/scm/PLAN-so-book-diff-
replanning.md` section 2).

A batch is born, best-effort, right after `outstanding_import_service.apply()` writes a
re-uploaded book: one row per PLANNED line the upload changed, what the line's active
decision holds today, the facts the suggestion rule used, and a suggested reaction the
planner already knows from the fulfilment board. Nothing is written to the plan until
`apply()` in this module runs, and that only touches the rows the planner accepted.

Kept ignorant of `outstanding_import_service`'s own internals beyond the `Diff` it hands
over - the same separation `project_so_ingest_service` keeps from the SCM import today - and
called from that module's `apply()`, never the reverse.

**`release` returns the WHOLE line to the board** (captain, 19 August 2026, PLAN section 6):
excluded from the new revision exactly like a `replan` row, so its Reserve hold is gone on
the next read AND its incoming/Buy parts are not carried either - they are re-proposed when
the line is next confirmed. `_check_line` permits no partial cover (a line named in a
`ConfirmLine` must sum to exactly its open quantity), so a "keep Buy, drop only Reserve"
composition has no seam without touching `project_supply_service.py`'s validation itself; a
real partial-cover seam is a follow-up, not this slice.

**`release` = releasing the project's claim ENTIRELY** (captain, 19 August 2026, correcting
the first cut of AC-R08): the reserve frees at its own location AND the Buy this line was
holding is no longer a purchase FOR this line - it becomes a POOL purchase. So a release is
not silent on Order Inquiry after all: every non-`actioned` OI row the line already raised
moves its `stock_location` to the line's pool (an `actioned` one keeps its location, already
bought, and gets the note only), and a `RELEASE` change row makes the same true in the
worklist the way a `DELAY` row does. Only the RESERVE side is silent - it is not a purchase,
so it raises nothing new.

Two further deliberate simplifications, flagged here because a future slice will want them
fixed properly rather than rediscovered by reading a bug report:

* **`replan` on `qty_up`** excludes the WHOLE line from the new revision (same as `advanced`)
  rather than freezing the existing covered quantity and running only the delta through the
  ladder - the same missing "partial confirm" seam.
* **`DATE_AND_QTY_CHANGED`** (both moved in one upload) is classified by DATE first: this
  build's own tie-break, because the section-0 table has no combined row and the two single
  changes disagree on suggestion.

**A line's already-`placed` Buy is invisible to the board's own ladder** (the captain, 20
Aug, diagnosing two live double-counts): `_proposal_for` asks `FulfilmentBoardService` to
walk the ladder for the line's FULL open quantity, and the board reads nothing off
`order_inquiry_rows` - it has no way to know part of that quantity is already covered by a
real purchase order tagged through section G's "Place on PO". `_apply_placed_offset`
relabels that much of the proposal's own Reserve/incoming rungs onto its Buy figure before
the row is stored, so the composition still balances the line's full open quantity but the
portion already bought reads as Buy - which `ProjectOrderInquiryService.refresh_for_decision`
then nets against the placed row itself, raising nothing further for it. See
`_inquiry_rows_and_buy_actioned` (reads `INQUIRY_PLACED` as actioned, same as `INQUIRY_ACTIONED`)
and `scripts/repair_20aug_placed_double_counts.py` for the two live rows this corrects.

    SO397450 / SRT382-6-DIY: an advance whose proposal took 432 from the pool at BRW while
    432 was already placed on a PO to the line's own bin): "instead of taking the 432 from

    taken the stock from BRW, there needs to be some replenishment to BRW, hence this
    order inquiry should change to location BRW, and it takes the outstanding PO to BRW."

    So when the fresh proposal itself draws on the shared pool, **the pool take STANDS** -
    the composition keeps that Reserve, and the placed PO(s) behind the overlapping
    quantity are REDIRECTED (by `_apply_placed_redirect`, at Apply, once a line's
    composition is actually posted) to replenish the pool instead of being relabelled onto
    Buy as if they no longer existed. `redirect_qty` below is that overlap - never more
    than `reserve`, which is already the ladder's own capacity-capped, affordable figure,
    so a redirect never claims more pool cover than the line was actually offered.

    **THE WATER IS OFFSET FIRST** (ladder v5's second pass, 27 August 2026). A placed PO is
    expected supply this line has already ordered, and so is the SPO share question 1 draws
    off the ownership group's net (`timely_spo`) - two promises of the same delivery, and
    counting both would promise the line twice. So `incoming` is relabelled onto Buy before
    anything is redirected: a PO replaces expected supply before it displaces stock on a
    floor, which is what the pool redirect does. Under v4 the live ladder proposed no
    incoming at all, so the order was invisible; under v5 it decides the answer.

    **Whatever `placed_qty` the water cannot cover then falls to the pool redirect**, capped
    at `reserve` so it never claims more pool cover than the line was actually offered. A
    pure-Buy proposal with no pool source at all (`reserve == 0`) redirects nothing, and the
    whole `placed_qty` is relabelled off `incoming` and added onto Buy exactly as before the
    ruling, with `sources`/`trail` trimmed in step (`_trim_sources_for_offset` /
    `_annotate_trail_for_offset`) so a stored proposal's own trail narrative never again
    claims a rung took stock the aggregate no longer credits it with (the original defect
    this function shipped with, on the same live row).

    ONE row for the whole freed quantity, however many purchase-order lines it came off: it

    A row of the same order inquiry with NO sales-order line of its own (AC-D3): it is not
    for anybody's order any more, it is stock coming to the pool, and the reorder engine
    counts it as cover the moment it is linked to the document. Nothing is unlinked and
    re-bought - a buyer's arrangement is kept, it simply belongs to the pool now.

    `item_code` is THE PRODUCT'S OWN CODE, resolved from the line, never the change row's
    (review round D1): `place_on_po_allocations` resolves a row with no line through
    `products.product_code`, and a book that names the item anything else - which a
    planning-change row copies verbatim - refuses the link with `order_inquiry_no_product`.
    That refusal used to leave an unlinked raised row at the pool, which reads as NEW
    demand, while the quantity it was supposed to carry sat unclaimed.

    Born acknowledged and company-stamped, UNLIKE the S1 flip in `PLAN-oi-confirm-per-so.md`:
    this row carries no `supply_decision_id` (it never sits on the board awaiting a decision -
    it is placed straight onto PO allocations in this same call), so it is not board-origin

    Dealer hot-selling wins outright (AC-D1): retail needs the pool stock, and a waiting
    project row does not get to outbid it. The verdict is the LIVE one, not the one the row
    was built with: a batch may sit for days, and where a quantity goes is decided by what
    is selling when it actually moves - the same reason the waiting rows are re-ranked here
    rather than addressed by an id the suggestion froze. Otherwise the linking engine's own
    priority decides which waiting row receives it (AC-D2), and whatever nobody needs goes
    to the pool (AC-D3). The receiving order is NOT re-planned: its row says "Found", its
    board reads the new state next time it opens (the grill page's decided 3.2).

    NOTHING IS SWALLOWED (review round D1). A refusal here fails the order's savepoint, so
    the batch says the order failed and why, and the pool row it may have written rolls back
    with it - rather than reporting success over a quantity that never moved.

    Returns `(executed, released)` (blocker B1, review round): `executed` is every
    `Reallocate ...` sentence, in `result_json["executed_reallocations"]`; `released` is
    the no-pool give-back sentence below, in `result_json["released_documents"]` - a
    single flat list used to conflate the two, so a cancelled line's honest "nothing moved,
    it is free again" read as an executed move.

    Where nothing moved between compose and apply, the two read identically, and where
    they differ the row records the truth rather than the plan.

    have one link taken and one left, and excluding the WHOLE row the moment ANY link was
    taken stranded the other link, pinned to a row purchasing can no longer act on. The
    correctness that used to come from that exclusion now comes from `_redeal_document`
    itself: for a cancelled row it caps what it redeals to what `document_links` shows is
    LIVE, read there after the shift, never the compose-time total.

    Returns, per planning row id, what it did IN WORDS (D5):
    `executed_reallocations` says where each moved quantity actually went, in the sentence
    the label used, and `released_documents` names an SPO given back, or a cancelled line's
    document nobody needed and no pool exists to carry (R3). The row's `result_json` keeps
    both, so the batch page can say what happened even when a later read of the live world

    The captain, 25 August 2026: "PO / SPO allocated to the 0 lines shift to the 25 line".
    A closed line's row is cancelled rather than deleted, so its links would otherwise sit
    on a row whose quantity nobody owes - real purchase-order quantity, arranged by a
    buyer, attached to an instruction that has been withdrawn.

    THE SURVIVOR IS THE SAME PRODUCT ON THE SAME SALES ORDER, and only as much as it can
    hold: the sum of a row's links may never exceed its own quantity (`order_inquiry_links`
    says so in a CHECK, and `committed_v` nets on it).

    **AS MUCH AS IT CAN HOLD IS A SPLIT, not a choice between all and nothing.** A survivor
    short of the whole placement used to be offered none of it and the entire link went
    back to the cascade - so a survivor with 6 of headroom against a 10-unit link ended up
    holding nothing, and a stranger's row took the lot. It now takes its 6 on a link of its
    own (the same document, the same purchase-order line, the same claim) and only the
    remaining 4 goes back, which is what "whatever that row cannot take goes back through
    the cascade" says. Going back means UNLINKED: the purchase-order line is free again and
    the next raised row waiting for that product can claim it. Nothing is dropped in
    silence - the removal writes its own "Unlinked from ..." stamp on the cancelled row,
    exactly as a person's Unlink does.

    `cancelled_row_ids` are the rows THIS apply just cancelled (`_retire_inquiry_rows`
    returns them). Read off the line instead, an old cancelled row that still carried links
    would have its documents re-dealt by a change that was never about it.

    `rule_six_line_ids` (review round, second re-walk) names which of these lines' own
    suggestion has a component `_execute_reallocations` can actually act on (`reallocate`,
    or `release`/`spo` - `_moving_components`'s own filter): ONLY for those does a link no
    same-order survivor touches at all get left alone here (no key in the returned dict)
    rather than unlinked, so `_apply_one_order` can route it to that cascade instead
    (cross-order raised row, else pool). A line named a `release`/`borrow` component (a
    step-3 supply-borrow's own release, say) has NO executor in `_execute_reallocations` at
    all - passing it through unresolved would strand the link, pinned to a row purchasing
    can no longer act on, so it is excluded from `rule_six_line_ids` by its caller and keeps
    the ORIGINAL behavior below regardless of a same-order survivor's own verdict.

    Returns, per closed line's `project_line_id` (D5, the same shape `_execute_reallocations`
    reports in on a confirmed row's `result_json`): `executed_reallocations` for a placement
    a same-order survivor took (whole or partial), `released_documents` for the remainder of
    a PARTIAL take, or of a placement no same-order survivor touched and rule 6 does not
    reach either. A PARTIAL same-order take keeps the OLDER behavior for its leftover
    (unlinked, given back to the ordinary reorder pass) unchanged, since that leg is already
    proven by `test_a_survivor_with_partial_headroom_splits_the_retired_links_qty_across_
    survivor_and_cascade` and rule 6's cross-order/pool cascade was never asked to reach a
    PARTIAL remainder, only a placement with no same-order taker at all.

    # row's decision nor apply again, with `pending: 2` on the list beside `Applied ...`
    # on the same row. `applied_orders` alone is not enough to gate on - an order that hit
    # `_apply_one_order`'s early return (nothing left `pending` to accept) lands in
    # `applied_orders` without writing anything, so a batch stuck failing would flip to
    # "done" on nothing more than a harmless retry. Left pending instead, the rows keep
    # their `failed` state and reasons, decisions stay editable, and this same call can
    # simply be retried once the cause is fixed.
    #
    # AND only once no order this apply LEFT OUT is still pending. `applied_at` is the
    # batch-wide lock (`set_row_decision` and a retry of this call both gate on it), so
    # stamping it after a narrowed apply froze every other order of the same upload at
    # `pending` with no way to decide or confirm them - the planner saw `Applied ...` and
    # `pending: 2` on the same row. An apply that visited every order is unchanged: there
    # is nothing left out, so the stamp lands exactly as it did before.
