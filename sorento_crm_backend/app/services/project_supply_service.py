"""Order promising: the supply composition sheet, and the one atomic confirmation.

Contract: `PLAN-scm-front-planning.md` sections 3.1 to 3.5 and 4,
`documentation/plans/scm/STAGE1C-scm-front-planning-promising.md` section 5, UAC groups B
and C.

The arithmetic is NOT here. It is the pure engine next door
(`app.services.scm.front_planning_engine`), so the rules can be tested without a database
and so the sheet and the commit cannot drift into two different opinions about the same
line. This file is everything around it: which facts are read, how the one location pile is
shared, what is rechecked at commit, and what is written.

Four ideas run through the whole file.

**Confirmation is one decision per SO, covering the lines the planner chose** (3.1, as
amended by PLAN-fulfilment-planning-from-autocount-so.md 13.4). It was atomic over every
line of the order; it is now atomic over every line of THIS confirmation:

> "we shouldn't block the confirm when the decision for the order are incomplete yet, we
>  might want to flow a few product to reorder planning first"   (captain)

One stale, unbalanced or unmapped line among the chosen ones still rolls back the whole
transaction, and the refusal still names every failing line by line number and item code.
No UUID ever appears in a message. What changed is that a line the planner did not choose
is EXPLICITLY UNDECIDED (`decided: false`, no snapshot, no allocation, no inquiry row) -
never implicitly zero and never implicitly covered - so its full open quantity keeps
counting as demand for reorder planning. That is the whole reason the captain wanted this,
and the per-line half of `scm.committed_v` (`app/services/scm/demand.py`) is what makes it
true rather than merely intended. There is still no per-line workflow STATE: a line is
covered by the order's one active revision or it is not.

**Every fact is re-read at commit** (AC-C03). The sheet may have been open for an hour, and
the stock behind it moves. The payload is a proposal, not an instruction: open quantity, the
line's share of timely SPO, Reserve eligibility, the BRW cap, donor availability and product
lifecycle are all recomputed from authoritative rows before anything is written.

**Confirmed cover is not free** (AC-B13). Free stock is on hand, minus reserved, minus what
active decisions (and legacy confirmed allocations, which belong to no decision) already
hold. The lines being REPLACED are excluded from that subtraction, or their own previous
revision would compete with the one replacing it - by line and not by order, because a
covered line the confirmation carries forward keeps its hold (13.4, the union is the
server's) and must be read as any other order's covered line.

**One pile, one order of consumption** (3.5). Several lines can want the same product at the
same location, and which of them gets the stock and which gets the incoming is decided by
`attribute_sources`, once, for every outstanding line at that product and location - not by
whichever line the database happened to return first.

        """Compose a WHOLE WALK: every entry in the order it is walked, keyed by its caller's
        own key, with the shared piles drawn down once as the walk passes them.

        `entries` is `(key, fact, unit_key)` in walk order, and the answer for each key is
        `(components, pool_open, borrow_open, net_open, options, other_group_open,
        supply_open, share_open, own_group_open)` - the composition, the five options behind
        it (R36), and what EVERY shared pile held when this LINE was reached: every site
        pool's free FLOOR by pool location (AC-N.12 - the asking bin's own pool used to be
        the only one carried), the cross-group donors by warehouse id, the five site
        pools' NET (the number that bounds rung 2, `pool_reserve_capacity`), what is left of
        each site pool's PROJECT SHARE (v8, R-B), and what is left of the unit's own
        ownership-group pile (v8, R-E). The board's proof states them from HERE rather than
        re-reading the live figures, which is how question 3 came to say "free stock at
        DC1-NT, within the limit" beside a Buy the ledger had just forced - and, until the
        last two were handed over, how question 1 came to offer the 135 at BRW-BB to the
        1,305 line that the 135 line had already taken (C3, code review round 4).

        THE UNIT (ladder v6, `PLAN-scm-order-unit-ladder-v6.md`). Entries sharing a
        `unit_key` are ONE quantity to plan: the captain, reading SO381895's lines 31 and 32
        - same item, same location, same delivery date - "this is 1 order as a whole, so we
        should look at the order as a whole instead of line by line". The engine's whole-line
        rule then applies to the unit, so 10 and 20 are covered from stock together or bought
        together, never "31 borrows and 32 buys". A unit's position in the walk is where its
        FIRST member appears (the board serves by rank, the sheet by line order, and neither
        ordering is disturbed); its members are filled in LINE order, so the sheet, the board
        and the freeze split one composition the same way.

        A unit of one line is `compose_line` exactly as before, on the fact itself.

        THE SHARED PILES are drawn once per unit, and this is the only place any of the
        ledgers lives: every site pool's free floor (`pool_free_left`), the cross-group
        donors (`borrow_left`), and the site pools' net (`pools_net_left`, per product -
        the net is ONE pile across all five pools, section 1d). All three callers used to
        keep the pool one and none of them kept the donor one - which is how four delivery
        dates of SO381895 were each proposed a Borrow of 10 from a location holding 10 in
        all, and why `confirm` refused every line but the first. The net one came the same
        day, from the same order one rung up: three delivery dates of TPE-9204 were each
        offered "30 of the 31 the site pools net between them", because the free-stock
        ledger stood at 3365 while the 31 was read fresh off the fact every time.

        A fact with an `unplannable_reason` is not walked at all (empty tuple), as before: a
        mirror line with no reconciled AutoCount line has no open quantity to promise
        against.

        location first then the siblings by site.

        The whole rung offers `max(group_net, 0)` and not a unit more - the group is one
        pile. `B2155-NL-BLUE` is the case that forced it: `MWH-IB` holds 7000 with nothing
        owed against it, and under v3 that read as 7000 free to promise, while `BRW-IB` -
        where the orders are booked - owed 27,804 against 5,290 on hand. The group nets
        -15,514, so there is nothing to take, and the line buys.

        HOW MUCH is `fact.group_offer` - what the group's own net leaves for this line
        (`_group_offer`). WHERE it comes from is each location's free stock, in draw order:
        this line's own first, then the siblings by site code. A
        location's OWN signed availability takes no part any more, and that is the whole
        change - it is the per-warehouse reading that let `MWH-IB` offer 7000 while the
        group was 15,514 short, and it would now refuse a draw the group's pile has already
        allowed.

        The order is decided here and nowhere else: `propose_line` walks the list it is
        handed and never re-sorts, so a planner reading "40 from BRW-BB, 30 from DC1-BB" is
        reading one decision about draw order, not two.

        LADDER V5 (section 1e): the group's SPO is inside `group_net` and there is no
        incoming rung above this one any more, so nothing is deducted here. The whole offer
        belongs to this question - which is what "SPO stays inside the group net" means when
        it is the only reading of the pile.

        WHAT IS ON THE WATER IS OFFERED TOO, because the group's net counts it (`on hand +
        SPO - SO`, AutoCount's own Available) while `_free_at` counts only what is on the
        floor. Without that, a group whose cover is an SPO would have an offer and no
        location to point at, and the cover would be lost to a Buy - which is the double
        purchase rung 1 existed to prevent, and exactly what AC-V2 refuses.

        THE WATER IS DATED AND IT IS DISTRIBUTED (captain, 27 August 2026). Two rules, and
        both were missing:

        * only water arriving ON OR BEFORE this line's required date may be drawn. The NET
          stays date-blind, because it is the group's position and not this line's promise;
          what THIS line may take out of it is not. Late water is named in question 1's own
          sentence with its date and never offered (`_group_water`);
        * it is drawn AT THE LOCATION IT IS COMING TO, in the same order the floor is drawn,
          not booked wholesale at `fact.own_code`. "40: 20 from BRW-IB, 20 on the water to
          MWH-IB arriving 3 Sep" is checkable against the cell's own table; "40 from BRW-IB"
          against a BRW-IB holding nothing is not.

        A water candidate is marked `water` and carries the day the whole of it has landed
        by; `propose_line` composes it as `timely_spo`, never as a Reserve, so no hold is
        written against goods that are not on a floor.

        R40 stopped the WALK from giving an undecided line another group's stock - the
        captain: "who is us to decide those BB group takes our IB pile" - and left the OFFER
        standing, because proposing is not assuming. This is that offer: what that group had

        (`supply_assignment.free_piles_at`). It becomes real only on Confirm, which writes a
        pinned hold, and only then does the pile deplete for everybody else.

        **S4 (1 Sep ruling): a PO event may never supply this offer either.** The captain's
        own repro named it exactly here - "Use incoming 15 from BRW-BB, arriving 6 Sep 2026"
        off a bin whose SPO qty was 0 and whose PO qty was 978 - so a PO event reaching this
        function is skipped outright, not merely relabelled.

        **R-M (3 Sep 2026): A LENDING GROUP'S PILE IS CAPPED BY ITS WHOLE OPEN BOOK.** The
        date-bounded pile above is the right question of the group that OWNS it and the
        wrong one of a group being asked to lend: demand due AFTER the asker's date is not
        subtracted from it, so an OVERSOLD group reads as a donor of free stock. The
        captain's cell: SO419417's BB line of 4 due 5 October was proposed "4 from BRW-IB
        ... free stock is owed to nobody" while BRW-IB held 2,237 against 2,684 of open IB
        demand - 447 short on its own book. So each other group's offer is
        `min(date-bounded free, max(group book position, 0))`
        (`supply_assignment.group_book_positions`), spread over its bins in the draw order
        they already come in. A group whose book is short gives NOTHING, and it says so:
        the second return value is `group -> how short`, which the `use` option row prints
        instead of a silent 0. The own group is untouched - its draw already stops at its
        own short.

        **THE BUDGET IS THE WALK'S, NOT THIS CALL'S.** `other_left` is `compose_lines`'
        offer ledger, and the group's spare book is seeded into it under

        `(own_group, other_groups, own_group_offer, other_group_short)`. The own half is
        the ASSIGNMENT's own
        draw (R24), in the order the ladder has always had - this line's own bin first, then
        its siblings by code, the floor before the water. The other half is the other
        PROJECT groups' free piles at this unit's date, which since R40 is an OFFER rather
        than something the walk already did (`_other_group_free_at_own_date`). It is a
        Reserve either way: free means owed to nobody, so nobody is owed it back (R5,
        AC-S3-1).

        THE QUANTITY IS THE ASSIGNMENT'S, NOT `group_offer`'s. Ladder v4 offered
        `max(group net + this unit's own quantity, 0)`, which is the group's position over
        its WHOLE book, 2030 lines included; v7.1 asks what was free BY THIS UNIT'S DATE.
        On SRTWB242 the two disagree by design: plain Available is -1,156 and 55 is free by
        15 September, so JEREMY reserves his 27 (AC-S3-1b). Where nothing earlier competes
        the two numbers are equal, which is why ladder v4's own suite keeps its figures.

        A location carrying NO ownership group is outside this step in both halves, the same
        rule ladder v4 kept: the group is what "our locations" means, and offering an
        ungrouped bin under that name would silently widen it.

        `own_left` is the same idea for the OWN half, and it exists for ladder v8's per-line
        walk (R-E): every contributing line of a planning unit is handed the SAME draw - what
        the assignment gave the unit's lines by their own date - so without a ledger the
        second line of SO419208's unit would be offered the 135 the first one has just taken.
        It is the UNIT's ledger and nobody else's; `compose_lines` opens a fresh one per unit.

        `other_left` is the walk's ledger for the OFFER half, warehouse code -> what is
        still on the table there (`compose_lines`). It exists because R40 took away the
        thing that used to bound it: while the assignment DREW cross-group, a second unit of
        the same board read a pile the first had already emptied, and now it reads the same
        free pile as the first did. That is the defect four delivery dates of SO381895 hit
        on the donor rung on 28 August 2026 - each offered the whole of one pile, and
        `confirm` refusing all but the first. It carries R-M's LENDING-GROUP budget in the
        same dict (`_group_budget_key`), because a bin ledger alone cannot bound a group
        whose bins come into view on different dates.

        `other_group_short` is R-M's refusal (3 Sep 2026): the OTHER groups whose whole open
        book is short, and by how much, so the walk can say "IB group is 447 short on its
        own book, nothing to spare" rather than print a 0 nobody can act on.

        offered the whole of it.

        """Step 3 (R32, R33): the ONE document that covers the whole unit.

        A supply event - an SPO allocation - is a candidate when it is ELIGIBLE and when the
        whole of this unit can be met off it alone. Everything else about the step follows
        from those two words.

        **Incoming means SPO** (31 Aug ruling, R-A, retiring R27/R29/R30/R35's PO half). A
        PO is still ON ORDER with a computed date, not goods on the water, and "Borrow
        incoming"/"Use incoming" must never name one - the captain's own production row
        named `202607-S0067`, a real PO issued with no expected date, as the thing a
        planner was told to borrow. A unit only a PO could cover falls through to the pool
        step and then to Buy; that is the point, not a regression. The ASSIGNMENT still
        reads purchase orders - the SPO cut out of a PO is still netted (`_po_rows`), the
        stock table's "PO qty" column is unchanged, and Stock Debt reads the same rows -
        only this step stops OFFERING one.

        **Eligible** (R32): it arrives by the asker's own date, OR before a fresh purchase
        raised today would land (`as_of + lead`). The second half is the captain's, on
        AC-S4-2b's row: "if buy, it is going to arrive even later". Such a line is late, and
        it is the earliest thing the ladder still has.

        **One document, whole** (R33): the quantity available off ONE event has to cover the
        unit. An SPO of 5 beside an SPO of 7 does not cover a unit of 12, and the walk moves
        on rather than promising one delivery on two dates. That is why this returns the
        rows of a single document and not a merged list - the engine walks what it is given,
        and a flat list of every eligible document would let it combine them.

        **Nearest arrival wins.** Every candidate here is an SPO - ARRIVING, cut from a
        purchase order and put on a shipment - so the ordering is nearest arrival first,
        then R19's donor order so two documents landing the same day are broken the way
        every other donor list is.

        **What is available off one document** is three things added together: what nobody
        has been promised (`free` in the assignment), what the walk has ALREADY GIVEN THIS
        ASKER on it, and what an ELIGIBLE later order holds of it - the same window and the
        same donor rules step 2 applies (`_eligible_donor`), because a donor that cannot
        itself wait is no donor whether it is holding stock or a promise.

        The middle term is the one this step was missing (SO414244, 30 Aug 2026): the
        assignment had already put 56 of a 75-line on a purchase order landing inside the
        window, so 19 read free, the whole unit did not fit and a line ONE document covers
        was bought instead. It is not a borrow and it names no donor - taking what the walk
        has already given you owes nobody anything - so it counts beside `free`, and the two
        make one row.

        `supply_left` is the walk's ledger, keyed by event (`compose_lines`). It counts what
        has been DRAWN, not what is left, because "what is left" is personal: a document
        held by a line of the asker's OWN order is worth nothing to that asker and the whole
        of it to the next order along, so seeding the ledger with the first asker's answer
        capped everybody after it (the step-2 donor ledger keeps the same shape for the same
        reason). Without a ledger at all, every unit of a board reads the same document whole
        and `confirm` refuses all but the first - the defect four delivery dates of SO381895
        hit on the donor rung on 28 August 2026.

        `need` overrides the fact's own open quantity, for the board's trail: the walk asked
        about the whole planning UNIT (R10) and the trail is built per ROW, so re-reading it
        with the row's smaller quantity would offer a document the walk itself refused.

        proposing different quantities for one line is the exact failure this module keeps
        being repaired for.

        `timely_qty` is netted here rather than in the ladder because it is read by

        and a figure that means "arriving" in one place and "arriving and free for this

        still shown (`timely_qty_before_group_net`); what it is not is available to a line
        whose group already owes 2,335 against it.

        LADDER V5, second pass (captain, 27 August 2026): `timely_qty` is now exactly the
        WATER SHARE question 1 offers - what `_group_take_candidates` marks `water`, and not
        a unit more. The two halves of that question come off ONE ledger, so a confirmation
        cannot post 80 of timely SPO beside a 40 Reserve against a group that only ever
        offered 40 of each. Capping at `group_offer` alone let exactly that through, because
        the floor share was never subtracted from it.

        THE CAPTAIN'S RULE, 26 August 2026, stated in the plan and in AC-L7: a group that
        cannot cover its own book offers nothing to any line of it, however much sits at any
        one of its locations. `B2155-NL-BLUE` nets -15514 across `BRW-IB` and `MWH-IB`, so
        the 60 is bought and `MWH-IB`'s 7000 is never on the table - it is already owed at
        `BRW-IB`, and promising it here is what creates the double allocation this ruling
        exists to stop.

        The rank queue takes no part. It was v3's own-location cap
        (`available_to_this_line`), it decided how much this line could have out of one
        WAREHOUSE, and it is exactly what the ruling replaced.

        Its OWN quantity is un-netted, and that is arithmetic rather than a softening:
        `sum(SO)` counts every open line at the group INCLUDING this one, so a line standing
        alone on exactly the stock it needs would read a net of zero and buy stock that is
        sitting there waiting for it. Every OTHER line's demand stays netted.

        THE CONSEQUENCE, named rather than buried: on a group whose book runs ahead of its
        stock, EVERY line of that group buys - the line at the front of the queue included.
        1,015 on hand against 9,080 owed proposes a Buy for the 80 at the front as well as
        for the 9,000 behind it. That is the rule as ruled: while the group is short, its
        stock is not promised to anybody in particular, and whoever ships first uses it.

        by PLAN-fulfilment-planning-from-autocount-so.md 13.4).

        The payload names the lines being confirmed. They commit together or not at all;
        a line it does not name and that NO active revision covers stays undecided and
        keeps flowing to reorder planning. A payload naming NO line is refused, because
        superseding the revision that is holding stock and putting nothing in its place
        is not a decision anybody made.

        **The union is the server's.** A line the ACTIVE revision covers that the payload
        does not name is CARRIED FORWARD into the new revision verbatim: the same frozen
        snapshot dict, the same holds copied row for row, no re-validation against live
        facts. The board posts only what the planner just decided (at day granularity it
        cannot even see every covered line), and re-posting a covered line rebuilt from
        its snapshot re-judged it against facts that had moved since - a discontinued
        product's covered line 422'd the confirmation of an unrelated one. A named line
        REPLACES its frozen one (that is an amendment).

        **The un-decide seam** (PLAN-so-book-diff-replanning.md section 10, defect found
        live 19 August 2026): a covered line this call is meant to DROP - not replace,
        not carry - names itself in `uncover_line_ids` instead of the payload. Without
        this, a planning-change batch's `release`/`replan`/`retire` row deliberately left
        OUT of the payload (so it returns to the board undecided) was carried forward
        verbatim by the rule above the instant any OTHER line on the SAME order WAS named -
        seen live: SO403765 rev 5 kept line 12's old Buy and old date after an ADVANCE was
        raised for it, because line 8's Release was the only line actually posted and line
        12 rode along uninvited. Named here, a line's snapshot is excluded from the carry
        outright: its hold is gone (`_carry_allocations` never runs for it), `_borrow_shortfalls`
        reads it as gone (`checked` no longer contains it), and `refresh_for_decision`
        treats it exactly as a line "absent from `buy_lines`" already does - cancels
        whatever it had raised. The only OTHER way a covered line leaves the decision
        remains a material change superseding the whole revision
        (`supersede_for_material_change`, which carries nothing at all) or a drift
        challenging it.

        **The settle-in-place seam** (`PLAN-scm-cs-planning-uat.md` part 3, AC-P3-5): a
        line named in `settle_in_place_line_ids` has its existing order inquiry row
        UPDATED - same id, new quantity, new date, links kept - instead of superseded and
        re-raised. Only a planning change sets it: it is the one caller that knows the
        book moved the same instruction rather than issuing a new one.

        **No confirmation links anything** (`PLAN-scm-oi-handshake.md`, captain 27 Aug
        2026). The rows this raises come out `awaiting`, and a document is tied to one only
        when purchasing ACKNOWLEDGES it. `auto_place_products` still comes back - the
        planning-change apply runs its own pass after it has shifted a closed line's
        documents to the survivor - but that pass links an acknowledged row and nothing
        else, so an ordinary board confirm ends with every new row unlinked.

        The caller owns the commit. Everything here runs inside it, including the Order
        Inquiry refresh, so purchasing can never be told to buy something that was not
        also promised.

        The site pool keeps a share back for dealers and lends the rest, so a line bigger

        remainder bought. Everything else the rule refused it still refuses: half a line off
        the ownership group beside a Buy is the composition purchasing cannot act on, and it
        is what this check exists for.

        Four conditions, all of them:

        * every from-stock unit is a RESERVE at a SITE POOL of this line's own chain (a
          borrow or a timely SPO beside a Buy is still a mix);
        * the line is INSIDE `immediate_window_days` - beyond it the pool is whole or
          nothing (R-B), so a part share there is not a composition the engine would ever
          make (review round 1, S8);
        * each pool's quantity is inside THAT POOL's own allowance, AND the pools' total is
          inside the ONE five-pool net (R-D, review round 2 blocker 2) - per-pool alone let
          two pools of 1,000 netting 100 between them be reserved 100 each, which is the
          over-draw the engine itself was making;
        * and the allowance is read off `pool_chain_for`, the SAME source `compose_lines`
          seeds its ledger from - never `fact.pool_available`, which is 0 for a bare site
          bin like `BRW-IB` and refused the composition the board had just proposed (review
          round 1, B2).

        DELIBERATELY WIDER THAN THE WALK (captain, 2 Sep): a Reserve at ANY site pool of the
        chain is admitted, not only the asking bin's own, because S3 lets a planner ADD a
        pool location to Reserve by hand (R-G) and the product must be able to confirm what
        it invites. The ENGINE's own R-L step stays whole-or-nothing, so it never composes
        another site's part share beside a Buy; this rule is about what a person may
        compose, and the allowance and the net are what bound them.

        THE SAME WALK `proposal_for` RUNS, over the whole ORDER and not over the lines the
        payload happens to name. The two shared ledgers and the planning UNIT are both
        properties of the walk, so a walk of one line composes that line as though it stood
        alone: confirming line 32 of a unit of 30 froze "Reserve 20 from the pool" beside it
        while the sheet had shown a Buy, and the snapshot is supposed to record what the
        planner was shown. A line the ladder cannot walk at all (no core line, no open
        quantity, no location) proposes an empty tuple, which is a different answer from an
        absent key.

        `lines` is the order's own lines, in line order, handed over by the caller that
        already read them; `covered` names the lines an active revision still holds and this
        confirmation is neither replacing nor releasing - the carried ones. They are out of
        the walk for the same reason they are out of the board's: a decided line is not
        re-planned, and its claim is already a hold in the facts rather than a place in a
        queue. ONE set, shared with the recheck (`confirm`), or the two disagree about which
        lines were planned together.

        IN LINE ORDER, not payload order, and that is load-bearing: the ledgers are drawn
        down in the order the walk goes, so the same lines posted in two orders would
        otherwise freeze two different proposals for the same board. `lines_of` is line
        order, which is what `proposal_for` walks too.

        `as_of` is the day the planner was deciding on, so the frozen suggestion is the one
        they saw rather than one recomputed against a later calendar. Defaults to today, in
        `compose_line`, which is what every caller sends.

        1. the DONOR's own placement on that document comes down for what it is giving up.
           First, because until it does the document reads as fully claimed and the asker's
           own link would be refused by the very rule that stops two rows pointing at one
           quantity;
        2. the ASKER gets an `ORDER_BACK`-verb row NAMING that document in `covered_by` -
           which is what that column has always meant, "why no ORDER row was emitted: the
           inbound that already covers this quantity" - and the link is written on it. The
           verb is ORDER_BACK because it is the only verb whose links may name an
           `spo_allocations` row (`OrderInquiryLink`), and the reason that rule exists is
           exactly this case: an order back is a shortfall against something already
           ordered, and the asker's is;
        3. the DONOR's own hole is already raised, at the donor's own date, by
           `_borrow_shortfalls` - the same writer step 2 uses, because it is the same fact.

        And then nothing else has to happen. `assign()` reads a link as a pinned hold
        (`stock_debt_service._holds`), so the next read of the book has the asker covered off
        that document and the donor short in its own month, with no second ledger to keep in
        step.

        A row raised by an EARLIER revision of this order for the same line is cancelled by
        `_retire_supply_borrows`, BEFORE the handoff rather than here - see that method for
        why the order is the whole of it.

        The captain: "when borrowed, does it / should it trigger an order back via order
        inquiries? Because I sort of need to return, right - or we should order back only if
        the available quantity of the borrowed location is negative?" **Only if negative.**
        A donor whose availability survives the borrow is not short of anything, and raising
        a buy for it would order stock nobody needs; a donor pushed below zero has a hole
        somebody must cover, and purchasing is told about the HOLE, not about the whole
        quantity that was taken.

        Aggregated per donor pile, because two lines of one order taking from the same
        location open one hole between them and not two.

        A Reserve drawn from the line's SHARED POOL is a donor by the same rule (13.11, the
        second rule). The captain, on a rung reading `Pool BRW | 4 | took 4`: "when we take
        from BRW, first we need to see its available quantity also, if available quantity is
        negative and if we want to take, we must have an order back just like mentioned."
        The pool's own book ranked BEHIND this line still wants that stock, and it shows in
        the pool's availability rather than in the queue ahead - so a pool take that leaves
        the pool's `on hand - SO + SPO` below zero opens a hole there, and purchasing is told
        about the hole at the POOL's location. A Reserve at the line's OWN location is never
        one: that location's demand IS this line, already inside its `SO qty`, and taking the
        reserve out again would count the same quantity twice. **A Borrow from the line's
        own location is never one either, for the same reason** - a dealer hot-selling
        product may only Reserve from the pool, so its own location is a legitimate Borrow
        source, and its demand is still inside that location's SO qty.

        The donor's availability is the AutoCount triple LESS what other confirmed
        decisions already hold there from elsewhere. A borrow, or a pool take, writes a
        hold and no sales-order line at the donor, so `on hand - SO + SPO` cannot see it,
        and a second borrower judged on the triple alone would be offered stock the first
        one has already taken. A hold whose line's own location IS the donor is left out:
        that demand is already inside the donor's SO qty.

        `checked` carries the named lines AND the carried ones (`_CarriedLine`), because
        a carried borrow still holds its donor's stock and the hole is the order's, not the
        revision's.

        nothing in the product said so - the captain's third finding of 25 August. One
        `proposed` row per such component; the Transfers page is where a person approves
        it deliberately.

        Read off `snapshots` rather than off `checked`, so a NAMED line and a CARRIED one

        revision's frozen dicts in the same shape, its transfers were just cancelled with
        that revision, and it therefore needs fresh ones or the movement it still implies
        would vanish because an unrelated line was reconfirmed.

        500 - and without the savepoint the failed statement would poison the transaction
        the promise itself is in, so catching the exception alone would not save it.

        **The failure is reported, not swallowed.** Returns `(written, failed, kept)`, which the
        confirm result carries to the planner (`transfers_written` / `transfers_failed`):
        a movement nobody was told about is a movement nobody makes, and a silent log line
        on a server is not telling anybody. `failed` is the number of components that
        SHOULD have raised a row, so the planner knows how many are missing and can

        Amended 19 August 2026 (the captain): "you should do the demand over project classed
        demand to judge project hot selling, same for dealer" - hot-selling is read off the
        DEMAND CLASS the ABC figure was computed against (`abc_class_retail` for dealer,
        `abc_class_project` for project), not off the warehouse's own segment. The demand
        class already states who bought it, so a warehouse's segment plays no further part
        and `Warehouse.segment == DEALER_SEGMENT` is dropped. The ranking itself is BY
        QUANTITY delivered in that class, not by value ("hot selling is by quantity, not
        related to money") - unlike the reorder engine's own value-based `abc_class`, which
        this predicate does not read.

        `computed_at` is display evidence, never a freshness gate: the existing ABC facts
        are the test, and adding an age threshold would be a new knob this contract forbids.

        Returns the dealer-hot set, the project-hot set, the unclassified set, WHERE each hot
        verdict earned it - the locations holding it as ABC A by quantity on that demand
        class, by code and sorted - and finally the dealer-classified / project-classified
        sets: every product carrying a NON-NULL letter on that column ANYWHERE, hot or not.
        The captain, reading a trail that never mentioned it: "where is the consideration of
        dealer hot selling?" A bare boolean would be something to take on trust; "ABC A at
        BRW" is something to check. The classified sets are what a "Cold at retail" / "Cold
        at project" chip is told apart from "no evidence of that class at all" with - a
        product can carry a real, non-A letter and still not be hot.

        "Unclassified" means no NON-NULL letter in EITHER column, not merely "a row exists".
        A NULL letter means no DELIVERED demand of that class in the trailing-12mo window -
        "unknown", never a computed verdict of "not hot". Reading that as "seen, therefore
        cold" would print a false "Not dealer hot-selling" for an item nobody has actually
        judged, which is the whole book today: every row is NULL in both columns because
        nothing has been delivered against them yet.

        Four decisions, each of which reverses what the column names suggest:

        * **Still on order is `qty_ordered - qty_received`, and nothing else** (R11,
          AC-S2-4). The netting the AC asks for is real, but it is already IN that
          subtraction: both writers of `spo_allocations.po_line_id` advance the source
          line's `qty_received` by exactly what they placed, in the same action -
          `allocation_suggestion_service.approve` ("the quantity moves from Ordered to
          Incoming in ONE action", its AC-G6 comment) and `spo_conversion_service.create`
          ("the pull ADVANCES the source PO line's own accounting"). Subtracting the open
          allocation as well deducted the same placement twice, so a line of 100 with 40
          allocated reported 20 on order instead of 60. Measured on the 30 Aug dev copy:
          every one of the 9 `spo_allocations` rows carrying a `po_line_id` names a
          `crm_spo` line, and none of them has `qty_received >= allocated`.
        * **A CRM SPO document is not an open purchase order.** `spo_conversion_service`
          mints a `purchase_orders` header stamped `crm_spo` to carry a shipment's leg of an
          existing PO; `incoming_by_location` contributes it at its own arrival, off the
          `spo_allocations` row hanging on it. Reading it here as well promises the units
          twice, and once a GRN receives part of that allocation the double stops even
          cancelling: 50 ordered, 0 received, 20 still allocated left a phantom 30 on order
          for a document that had half landed.
        * **The arrival is computed, not read** (R29). `expected_date` on this book is the SO
          delivery date the buyer typed the line against, so the date the goods would land is
          `issue_date + the supplier's lead time`. The typed date travels as `bought_for`.
        * **The lead time is the SUPPLIER'S** when the agreement states one for this product
          and supplier, then the product's own fastest, then `DEFAULT_LEAD_TIME_DAYS`. The
          fallback is read through the BATCHED `lead_times()` for the whole page before the
          first row is walked, never through the scalar `_lead_time_days` per line: the
          Stock Debt list asks about a thousand products at once, and one round trip each
          cost ~1,900 extra queries per request on the dev copy.

        A PO with no issue date carries `arrival_date = None` and is returned anyway. The
        assignment refuses to count an undated document, and the drill still lists it - a
        document nobody mentions reads as a document that is not there.

        Two shapes, and they are answered differently: free stock at a location outside
        the Reserve pool has no donor to ask, so it carries no claim; stock another
        project is holding names that project and its impact, so CS is deciding with the
        donor's position in front of them (AC-B09).

        **Every donor states AutoCount's own triple beside the engine's figures** (PLAN
        13.11). Free stock alone nets reserved and confirmed holds only, and on this book
        almost nothing is confirmed, so "6,990 free" reads as a donor with plenty when
        47,000 is owed there. `qty_on_hand`, `so_qty`, `spo_qty` and the signed
        `available_qty` are the sentence the planner needs before taking somebody's stock.

        **The list is RANKED by what meeting THIS line would leave the donor with**, which is
        the answer to the captain's "I assume this list is ranked by recommendation, is it?" -
        it was not. The key is `available_after_need = available_qty - need`, where `need` is
        the line's residual at this rung (what the ladder was otherwise going to buy),
        descending, then availability descending, then free descending. The first row, and
        only the first, is `recommended`.

        A donor is never judged on giving away the WHOLE of its free stock. That was the first
        rule here and it was wrong in the way that matters: a location holding 11,000 with 140
        owed against it ranked below one holding 7,000 with nothing owed, so the screen
        recommended the smaller pile to cover 21 units.

        one whose own delivery is nearest.

        somebody else confirmed a moment earlier - must never take the orders around it down
        too, or "Confirm all" would silently discard decisions the planner had gotten right.
        So each entry is tried, committed or rolled back, on its own; the caller gets a result
        named by `pso_id` either way, and a later entry runs whether or not an earlier one
        failed (no silent partial success - every order is accounted for in the reply).

        `entries` duck-types `ConfirmSupplyBody` per order (`.pso_id`, `.lines`), which is why
        `confirm` itself needed no change: it never learns this call has siblings.

        `write` swaps WHAT one order's press does and nothing else - the per-order
        transaction, the refusal handling and the shape of the reply are this method's
        either way. The board's single Confirm on a `?batch=` board passes the planning
        change's own apply (`_confirm_a_planning_change`), so a press that answers a batch
        applies it rather than writing an ordinary revision beside it (AC-P3-4).
