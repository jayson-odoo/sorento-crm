"""Which photograph of a product the system shows. One decision, read by everybody.

`product_attachments.is_primary` is that decision. It is **product master data, not a feature of
whoever happens to be rendering it**: the Dealer Kit brochure is one consumer, 3D-model generation
is another, and the project quotation is the third. Each reads this module rather than asking the
question a second time, because two answers to "which picture is this product" is the same as no
answer - the tile, the mesh and the customer's quotation would silently disagree.

**Among several photographs nothing is chosen automatically.** Ordering by `sort_order` and
taking the first row looks like a reasonable default and is not: for `SRTWC286-SH` the
first-linked row is one of 31 files including a blank page and two other products' photographs. A
wrong photo is a wrong product in front of a customer, and the same wrong photo fed to a mesh
generator is that plus a bill. So a product with several photographs and nobody's answer reports
`NOT_CHOSEN` and shows nothing, which is a state a screen can act on; a guess is not.

**One photograph and nobody's answer IS the answer** (QUOTATION-UX, owner 14 Oct, AC-QLG06): in
dev 2,060 of 2,308 products with photographs carry exactly one, so "not chosen" there was a click
that could only ever pick that one. `is_primary` still wins whenever it is set.

Four things are excluded from being a photograph at all, in every query here, and they have to
stay in step or a screen will count a product as done and then fail to show its picture:

- a non-image mime type (the live data holds 532 PDFs linked to products - a spec sheet rendered
  as the product photo is worse than no photo),
- a deleted attachment (611 live links point at one; Resource Management already hides them, so
  signing a URL for one puts a broken picture on a customer's document),
- a technical drawing (an image typed "Technical Specifications"): it is the TECHNICAL SPEC
  column's picture, never the product's photograph. A typeless image still counts as a photo,
- for a *chosen* image, all of the above - a choice made before the file was deleted must stop
  being an answer, not linger as a broken one.

`render` exists because the artifacts embed bytes rather than link to them. The mean chosen image
in live data is 1.1 MB and the largest 4.3 MB, while the column it lands in is 60 CSS px wide, so
everything is downscaled into a bounded box first. Fifty-two originals inlined is a PDF nobody can
email.
