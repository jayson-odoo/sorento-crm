"""Fold every (company, debtor code) group of customers onto one survivor (DEBTOR-CODE-UNIQUE).

Card: documentation/plans/autocount/CARD-debtor-code-unique-04oct.md (R5-R13, Q1-Q5 all (a)).
CLI: `scripts/merge_customers_by_code.py`. Never run by alembic or on deploy.

Per group (company + `lower(btrim(customer_code))` holding more than one row):

- Survivor: `customer_identity.SURVIVOR_ORDER_SQL` (code-form AutoCount ref, any ref, oldest,
  lowest id). It keeps its own name, code and ref.
- Held (owner 4 Oct, decision (b)): a group whose retired names are another business once
  normalised (`normalise_name`, `held_reason`) is not merged unless its CSV row says
  `release=yes`; `301-*` cash codes are never held. The code-unique index waits for them.
- Fields: a blank on the survivor is filled from the retired rows, oldest first. Where both hold
  a value and differ on a `CONFLICT_FIELDS` column the group is a CONFLICT: `apply` skips it
  unless the owner named a `keep` row for it, whose values then win on those columns.
- Documents: an order / sales order with no `debtor_name` gets the retired row's name first, so
  no document loses the buyer name it showed.
- Every FK onto `customers.id` (read from `pg_constraint` at run time, never a list) moves to the
  survivor, except WhatsApp contact links (`respond_contact_customers`, an external contact's
  access): those are dropped and listed for CS to re-link (owner, 4 Oct). Unique collisions are
  resolved first and every dropped row is kept in full: a second main contact becomes
  stakeholder, a duplicate item-code mapping keeps the survivor's, retired AutoCount refs are
  dropped (`uq_integration_ref_entity`: one per row; the survivor's wins).
- The retired names become `customer_aliases`; the retired row is deleted.
- `customer_merge_map` holds everything `revert` needs, and one `audit_logs` row
  `action = 'EVENT'`, `event = 'customer.merge'` per retired id names it on the survivor (the
  `audit_logs_action_check` from migration `aud_0001` allows only CREATE / READ / UPDATE /
  DELETE / IMPORT / EVENT; the business verb lives in `event`). Old audit rows are never rewritten.

Everything here is raw SQL against whatever `customers` the session's search_path resolves, so
the caller decides the transaction (`--apply` commits once per company).
