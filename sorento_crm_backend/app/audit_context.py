"""Request-, job- and tick-scoped audit actor for automatic audit logging.

One ``AuditActor`` says who did a write (identity S0, #1280; plan section 8):

- ``user_id`` is the EFFECTIVE actor (the impersonation target when an admin is
  impersonating), ``real_user_id`` is who was at the keyboard. They differ only
  under impersonation; ``created_by`` / ``updated_by`` columns keep the effective
  user and ``real_user_id`` records the admin (plan 8.2).
- ``actor_type`` is user | contact | integration | worker | scheduler |
  public_link | system.

Carriers. ``stamp_actor`` writes the actor to three places at once:

- the contextvar, for code on the same context (async dependencies, the path op,
  an RQ job run in-process, a scheduler tick);
- ``db.info["audit_actor"]``, which lives on the Session object and so survives
  FastAPI running a sync dependency in a different threadpool thread from the
  path op and the flush (the AC-12 gap);
- ``request.state.audit_actor``, read by the API call log middleware.

``get_actor(db)`` prefers ``db.info`` over the contextvar.

``get_audit_context`` is the one older reader kept, for its service callers.

Audit standard S0 (#1281) adds no actor of its own: WHO acted is always the ``AuditActor``
above (plan section 8 of PLAN-unified-identity-26sep.md is the actor contract). S0 adds only
the BUSINESS action around it, an ``AuditContext``: the ``@audit_event`` verb, the reason,
the channel (``source``) and the ``correlation_id`` that ties one action's rows together
across the request and its jobs. ``LoggingMiddleware`` puts a fresh one in a contextvar at
the start of every request and code MUTATES it rather than calling ``.set()``: a sync
dependency runs on a COPIED context in a threadpool, and a copy still holds the same object.
