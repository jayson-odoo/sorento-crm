"""The customer's counter-sign page, reached by a tokenised link.

Public on purpose, and narrow on purpose. The token identifies ONE issue, expires, and is the only
credential; nothing here takes an id from the caller, so a leaked link exposes exactly the one
quotation it was minted for and nothing else in the project.

An unknown token and an expired token get the SAME answer. Distinguishing them would confirm to
anybody guessing that a token exists.
