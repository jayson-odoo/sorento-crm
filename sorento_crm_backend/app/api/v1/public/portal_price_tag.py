"""Portal price tag request endpoints.

Mounted at ``/api/v1/public/portal`` alongside the existing portal router.
Auth: portal token (``get_portal_token`` dependency).

These endpoints are separate from ``portal.py`` because price tag requests use
a dedicated service (``PriceTagRequestService``) rather than the generic
``PortalService`` CRUD, and keeping them apart avoids bloating the already-large
portal module.
