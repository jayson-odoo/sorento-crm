"""Fulfilment Planning: the reconciliation worklist, the supply sheet, the confirmation.

Contract: `documentation/plans/scm/STAGE1B-scm-front-planning-reconciliation.md` section 3
and `STAGE1C-scm-front-planning-promising.md` section 6.

Five routes, mounted on the same `/project-sales` root as the sales-order ones because
they are addressed the same two ways: a cross-project worklist, and one order by id.

Rights follow the rest of the module: reads take `projects.projects.view`, and the re-run
takes `projects.projects.edit` on that project, checked in `project_service` like every
other project write. The re-run is a WRITE (it persists the links it can prove and clears
the ones that went stale), so it is `require_permission`, not the API-key variant.

Mounted BEFORE `sales_orders.router` for the same reason `divergences` is: these paths hang
off `/sales-orders/{pso_id}`, and keeping every declaration of that prefix ahead of the
plain `/sales-orders/{pso_id}` one removes any question of shadowing.

    order named in `orders`, rather than one call per order from the panel. One order's own
    refusal (a stale line, a line somebody else confirmed a moment earlier) never takes the
    orders around it down: each entry commits or rolls back on its own, and every order named
    in the body gets a result - there is no silent partial success. `orders: []` answers with
    an empty result rather than a refusal; a board with nothing approved yet is not an error.

    `batch_id` travels PER ORDER now (`PLAN-scm-board-picks-up-pending-change.md`, change 4,
    AC-B5/AC-B6). The body-level `batch_id` is the LEGACY shape and only applies when NO
    order in the payload names a non-null `batch_id` of its own: the instant at least one
    order carries a real id, the body-level id is ignored for every OTHER order in the same
    payload, including one that explicitly said `batch_id: null` - it must not silently
    inherit a batch a sibling order in the same press answered (reviewer finding B1,
    39a5d8b07: the frontend already sends both a body-level id AND a per-order `null` on a
    mixed board, and `entry.batch_id or payload.batch_id` could not tell "this order
    legitimately has none" from "this order said nothing", so it tried to apply order A's
    batch against order B, which held none of its rows). A payload where every order's
    `batch_id` is null or absent still falls back to the body-level id for all of them,
    exactly as before this fix - that is the legacy, single-batch shape. An order that
    resolves to a batch takes the same apply the per-order Confirm takes for a `?batch=`
    board (one press, one call, one revision, batch rows marked applied); an order with
    neither confirms as an ordinary revision beside it.
