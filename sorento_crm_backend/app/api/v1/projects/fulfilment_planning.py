"""Fulfilment Planning: the reconciliation worklist, the supply sheet, the confirmation.

Contract: `documentation/plans/scm/STAGE1B-scm-front-planning-reconciliation.md` section 3
and `STAGE1C-scm-front-planning-promising.md` section 6.

Five routes, mounted on the same `/project-sales` root as the sales-order ones because
they are addressed the same two ways: a cross-project worklist, and one order by id.

Rights follow the rest of the module: reads take `projects.projects.view`, and the re-run
takes `projects.projects.edit` on that project, checked in `project_service` like every
other project write. The re-run is a WRITE (it persists the links it can prove and clears
the ones that went stale), so it is `require_permission`, not the API-key variant.

Mounted BEFORE `sales_orders.router` for the same reason `divergences` is: these paths hang
off `/sales-orders/{pso_id}`, and keeping every declaration of that prefix ahead of the
plain `/sales-orders/{pso_id}` one removes any question of shadowing.

    order named in `orders`, rather than one call per order from the panel. One order's own
    refusal (a stale line, a line somebody else confirmed a moment earlier) never takes the
    orders around it down: each entry commits or rolls back on its own, and every order named
    in the body gets a result - there is no silent partial success. `orders: []` answers with
    an empty result rather than a refusal; a board with nothing approved yet is not an error.

    `batch_id` travels PER ORDER now (`PLAN-scm-board-picks-up-pending-change.md`, change 4,
    AC-B5/AC-B6). The body-level `batch_id` is the LEGACY shape and only applies when NO
    order in the payload names a non-null `batch_id` of its own: the instant at least one
    order carries a real id, the body-level id is ignored for every OTHER order in the same
    payload, including one that explicitly said `batch_id: null` - it must not silently
    inherit a batch a sibling order in the same press answered (reviewer finding B1,
    39a5d8b07: the frontend already sends both a body-level id AND a per-order `null` on a
    mixed board, and `entry.batch_id or payload.batch_id` could not tell "this order
    legitimately has none" from "this order said nothing", so it tried to apply order A's
    batch against order B, which held none of its rows). A payload where every order's
    `batch_id` is null or absent still falls back to the body-level id for all of them,
    exactly as before this fix - that is the legacy, single-batch shape. An order that
    resolves to a batch takes the same apply the per-order Confirm takes for a `?batch=`
    board (one press, one call, one revision, batch rows marked applied); an order with
    neither confirms as an ordinary revision beside it.

    DRAFT - never off the request body, which carries no reason of its own (owner ruling
    23 Sep 2026, `PLAN-board-reject-on-confirmed-line.md`: reject on a confirmed line is
    STAGED, and the draft `save_draft` already wrote is the one place the reason lives).

    Refused 422 `board_line_reject_reason_required` when an id does not resolve to a
    line on THIS order, carries no draft, or that draft's own verdict is not `rejected`
    with a non-blank reason - a stale client (a tab open since before the reject, a race
    with another planner) is exactly what this defends against, the route never trusting
    an id on its own. Also refused when an id appears in `named_lines` too (`payload.lines`)
    - a line cannot be REPLACED and DROPPED by the same press.

    B1 (fix round, review): an id also has to be COVERED BY THE ACTIVE DECISION, checked
    HERE rather than left to `uncover_lines`' own bare `bool` (which the withdrawal-only
    caller used to ignore outright - a stale tab could Confirm a withdrawal for a line
    nobody still covers, and the mixed path never checked at all). A stale client is
    refused the SAME 422 either way - `board_line_withdrawal_not_covered` names the
    actual cause rather than reusing `board_line_reject_reason_required`, which would
    read as "you forgot the reason" on a line that never had anything to withdraw.
    Loaded ONCE for the whole call: every id in `rejected_line_ids` is checked against
    the SAME active decision, never a fresh read per id.

    N4 (nit, fix round): `covered_ids` above is deliberately a bare "does the active
    decision's own `line_snapshots` name this id" - unlike `_active_coverage`
    (`project_line_draft_service.py`), it carries NO `_in_open_planning_change` exemption
    for a line sitting in a batch nobody has applied yet. That is safe here, not an
    oversight: this function is only ever reached from `confirm_supply` /
    `confirm_all`'s shared seam, which already refuses `rejected_line_ids` alongside a
    `batch_id` outright (422 `board_reject_not_supported_in_batch`, AC-B12) BEFORE this
    function is called - a withdrawal never reaches a batched line in the first place, so
    there is nothing for the exemption to do here. `_active_coverage` still needs its own
    exemption because `save_draft` (a batched line's OTHER verdicts - amend, approve) is
    reached with no such upstream refusal.

    Returns the reasons keyed by `project_line_id`, and the ONE sentence the superseded
    revision is stamped with instead of `_write_decision`'s own "Reconfirmed by CS." -
    every rejected line named, in order: "Line 2 rejected: wrong site; Line 5 rejected:

    a staged rejection, never the draft save.

    `batch_id` is the CALLER's own resolved id (`confirm_supply` reads `payload.batch_id`
    directly; `confirm_all`'s `write_one` folds in the body-level fallback first) - kept as
    an explicit argument rather than read off `payload` again so the two callers' different
    fallback rules never have to be reconciled here.

    (`_confirm_a_planning_change`) has no shape for `uncover_line_ids` - it turns the

    states ("a revision minted anywhere else - `uncover_lines` after a rejection... is never
    wrapped... not undoable"), and this rework's `elif rejected_line_ids:` branch below is
    exactly that call. A withdrawal riding alongside `payload.lines` reaches `uncover_lines`
    THROUGH `confirm()`'s own `uncover_line_ids` parameter instead, which stays inside the
    journal exactly as an ordinary reconfirm does - undoable, as the plan states.
