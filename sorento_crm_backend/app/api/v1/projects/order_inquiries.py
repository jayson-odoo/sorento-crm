"""Order inquiry rows, their state and the export (P10, AC-I1 to AC-I7).

Reading is the project's own view grant, because the inquiry is part of reading a
project. ACTING on a row is `projects.order_inquiry.action`, which is purchasing's grant
rather than the project owner's: the row is purchasing's work and they do not own the
project it came from, so gating it on project edit would mean granting purchasing the
right to edit every pursuit in the company.

Rows are never created here. They are DERIVED when a sales order or an amendment
publishes, which is the only moment the instruction is true.

    Omitted, it is the reorder plan's own horizon; `link_horizon: "none"` is how a caller
    asks for no horizon at all (S1).

    `row_ids` and `filter` are mutually exclusive (AC-CF-8c, refused at the schema when
