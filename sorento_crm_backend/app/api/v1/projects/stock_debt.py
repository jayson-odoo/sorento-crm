"""Stock Debt: the month x product board, the cell drill and the workbook export
(S2, R22/R28; extended 24 Sep 2026, PLAN-stock-debt-filters-totals-export-24sep.md).

    GET  /project-sales/stock-debt
    GET  /project-sales/stock-debt/{product_id}/cell?month=
    POST /project-sales/stock-debt/export

All three behind `projects.stock_debt.view` (AC-S2-8; the permission and its grant
sweep from `projects.projects.view` ship in migration 443 with S1). Its own permission
rather than the module's general view right because this screen states the whole book's
exposure - every customer's shortfall on one page - which is not the same grant as reading
a project. The export route reuses it too (AC-12): exporting states nothing new, it only
prints what the board already answers.

Mounted before the projects router for the same reason its siblings are: `/project-sales/
stock-debt` is a literal segment that `/projects/{project_id}` must not capture.
