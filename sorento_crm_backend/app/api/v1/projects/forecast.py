"""Forecast and dashboard API (S5a, UAC Group I).

One composite read for the dashboard plus the three pieces separately, because the pipeline
page wants only the headline numbers and should not pay for the salesperson breakdown.

Every literal segment (`/forecast`, `/dashboard`) sits under `/reports/`, which keeps it
clear of `/projects/{project_id}` -- the shadowing trap `test_route_shadowing` watches for.
