"""Spec Registry API - the vocabulary both the CRM ranker and the n8n parser read.

One vocabulary, two consumers, so this endpoint is the thing that stops them drifting:
if the parser emits `wall_mounted` while the ranker looks for `wall_hung`, every query
quietly scores worse and nothing logs an error.

Writes exist, and they are shaped by that guarantee rather than around it:

  * a `seed` row is repaired on every deploy, so editing its vocabulary would be undone.
    Staff extend it instead - `user_synonyms` is merged in at read time, additive only,
    so a word added here can never remove one the parser depends on.
  * a `user` row has no seed to drift from and is left alone entirely.
  * calibration (`rank_weight`, `is_active`, the match window) has always been
    human-owned on both.

So: add words and tune weights freely; renaming a shipped VALUE is deliberately not
offered, because that is the one edit that breaks the two consumers apart.

    A count on its own ("seen in 106") is not reviewable: it says something happened
    without saying to what. This is how you check a rule did what you meant before
    trusting it in a search - and how you find the row that proves it did not.

    Grouped counts come back with the list so a whole key can be judged at a glance:
    `has_drainer` reading `true` on 74 bathtubs is obvious in the tally and invisible
    in a page of rows.

    `class_label` and `source` narrow the query itself, not the page that came back -
    a key with 10,000 rows only has one page loaded client-side, so filtering the page
    would silently report on whatever happened to land on it. The tallies are computed
    before those two filters (though after `value`/`q`, which already narrowed the set
    they describe), so the Class and Source dropdown options stay complete once one of
    them is picked, instead of collapsing to the choice just made.
