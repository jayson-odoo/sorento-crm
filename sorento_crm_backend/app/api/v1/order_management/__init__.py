# `customers_select` FIRST. Both mount at `/customers`, and `customers.router` carries
# `GET /{customer_id}` - so mounted first it matches `/customers/select`, tries to read
# "select" as a customer id and answers 404 "Customer not found. Someone might have deleted
# it already." Every screen with a customer dropdown then shows that toast on load, which
# reads as a data problem rather than a routing one. FastAPI matches in registration order,
# so the literal path has to be registered before the parameterised one. Same defect family
# as the SLA `/integration/escalate` shadowing.
