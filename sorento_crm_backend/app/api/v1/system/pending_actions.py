"""Deferred record actions - park, cancel, read (D7, S6).

The product has no confirmation dialogs. A destructive or reversible action is parked
HERE for the length of its grace window; the button becomes a countdown with a Cancel,
and the server applies it when the window lapses - even if the tab is closed. Three
routes are the whole contract the frontend consumes:

    POST /api/v1/pending-actions              park it, 202
    POST /api/v1/pending-actions/{id}/cancel  withdraw it, 200 before / 409 after
    GET  /api/v1/pending-actions/current      what is parked, and how the last one ended

Two things this file owes the reader on screen:

* **`last_outcome`.** A countdown that simply disappears reads exactly like success, so
  a commit that FAILED has to be legible afterwards, by `status` and `action_key` - a
  delivery order carries both a status change and a delete, and only the key tells the
  two apart.
* **The lazy commit.** GET applies an action whose window has already closed, before it
  answers. The scheduler sweep (`form_action_commit`) covers the records nobody is
  looking at; this covers whoever is. A stopped scheduler may DELAY an action, never
  lose one.

The engine underneath is the form-SLA one, unchanged: same table, same claim-then-run
commit, same partial unique index that allows one pending action per record.
