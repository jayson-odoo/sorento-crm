"""The low stock report over chat (S5, AC-40..AC-50).

`PLAN-low-stock-report.md`. Staff type "low stock report" into WhatsApp; the bot ALWAYS
runs a FRESH plan (owner ruling 1, 14 Sep), so this route creates a run, a download row and
two queued jobs, then holds the turn open for
`system_settings.low_stock_sync_wait_seconds` waiting for the workbook. If it lands in
time the turn carries it; if it does not, the route hands delivery to the worker and
answers `pending`.

**Its own module, not a second handler in `order_summary.py`**: this is the chatbot's
route, it is reached with an API key, and it carries a gate none of the others do.

-- SECURITY: THE SECOND GATE -------------------------------------------------
`require_permission_with_api_key("scm.reorder.run")` answers "may this integration run
plans". That is NOT the question this route has to answer, which is "may THIS CONTACT have
the low stock report" - and this route WRITES (a run, a download row, two jobs). The
`require_permission_with_api_key` docstring's own rule for a writing endpoint is that it
carries a second, caller-specific gate; here that gate is the per-contact reveal key
`scm.low_stock_report`, resolved and checked IN-ROUTE before anything is created. Without
it: 403 `low_stock_report_not_enabled`, no run, no download row, nothing enqueued (AC-41).

Two consequences worth stating plainly:

* The act-as principal behind `EXTERNAL_API_KEY` (or an integration's `act_as_user_id`)
  MUST hold `scm.reorder.run`, or every contact - granted or not - gets a 403 from the
  FIRST gate and the feature is silently off. That is a DoD item on this lane.
* `include_supplier` follows a SECOND reveal key, `purchase_orders.supplier` (AC-47). A
  contact without it gets a workbook with no Supplier column at all, rather than a blank
  one: a blank column still says "there is a supplier and you may not see it".

**GET, not POST.** The MCP compiler injects `view=render` only on tools with no body
params (`server.py:1604-1612`) and the chatbot lane sends `view=render` on every call, so a
POST tool would never reach the presenter. `ToolSpec.read_only` already says METHOD IS
TRANSPORT, NOT SEMANTICS, and `crm_portal_link_get` is the precedent for a read-listed tool
that mints an artefact.

    (10 s by default, `lanes/business/services.py`), which is SHORTER than this setting's

    never reached its own timeout branch and so never set `deliver_to_contact_id`. The

    hangs up is what makes the claim happen, so the worker pushes the file.

    `chatbot_mcp_timeout_seconds` is deliberately NOT raised here: it is every tool's knob,

    An API-key request has no company scope of its own - `_resolve_api_key_scope` reads the

    is not set by it - so every company-scoped insert refuses with 400
    `company_scope_required` until one is chosen. The rule, in order:

    0. **The scope the session already carries**, when it is exactly one company. A
       caller that resolved one upstream has already answered this question, and
       overriding it here would let this route plan a different company's book from the
       one the rest of the request reads.
    1. **The contact's own company**, when it has exactly one - read off
       `respond_contact_companies` for the contact this route ALREADY resolved, so the
       plan is built for the company whose stock the asker can actually see. Keyed on that
       resolved id rather than through `resolve_contact_company_scope`, which re-resolves
       the identity with the STRICT workspace join: the 16 NULL-workspace contacts (the
       ones this chatbot actually serves) drop out of it, which is the whole reason
       `resolve_contact_with_null_workspace_fallback` exists. One identity, resolved once.
    2. **The owner user's active company** when the contact maps to several or none - the
       CRM user linked to the contact, else the act-as principal. `last_active_company_id`
       when it is still granted, else the single grant, else the lowest granted id: the
       fail-closed tail of `company_scope_resolver._resolve_user_scope`, minus the JWT
       claim, because an API-key request carries no token to read one from.
    3. **Neither** -> return None, nothing written. `_prepare` turns that into the error
       miss shape (reviewer S1/AC-44a) rather than an HTTP 400, so the bot says "Could not
       run the low stock report right now." instead of surfacing a status code. A run

    `contact_id` and `space_id` are REQUIRED (422 without): this route exists for the
    chatbot and for nothing else, and without a contact there is nobody to check the reveal
    key against or to push the file to (AC-40).

    Four answers, all HTTP 200, because each is something the bot can SAY:
      * `ready`   - the workbook landed inside the budget; the turn carries it.
      * `pending` - it did not; the worker will push it when it does (AC-44).
      * `busy`    - a plan is already running, or the contact is over the rate limit (AC-49).
      * `error`   - it could not be produced (no company, excluded product, broker down, or
                    the worker marked the run `failed`); the bot says so, never `pending`
                    (reviewer S1 / AC-44a).

    Every blocking step runs off the event loop via `asyncio.to_thread` (security B1); the
    request session's connection is returned to the pool by `_prepare`'s commit and is not
    used again until after the wait, and the wait polls on its own short-lived sessions.
