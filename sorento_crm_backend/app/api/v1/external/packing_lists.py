    Every user-facing surface (upload-activity drawer, attachment integration
    panel) reads the ``error_code`` / ``error_message`` COLUMNS. n8n's error
    branch only posts ``{status, response_payload}``, leaving both NULL - so the
    drawer would show a bare "Integration failed" while the real reason sat
    unread inside response_payload. Stamping the columns here puts the
    explanation where the UI already looks.

    Safe against n8n's follow-up callback: IntegrationLogService updates with
    ``model_dump(exclude_unset=True)``, so the status POST cannot clobber these.
    Deliberately does NOT set ``status`` - that stays n8n's to report.
