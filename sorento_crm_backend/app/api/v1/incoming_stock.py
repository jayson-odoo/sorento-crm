"""User-facing incoming-stock API.

Purpose
-------
A tight, business-rule-compliant surface for answering "is there any incoming stock?" questions.
Intended to be the primary route used by the AI assistant / MCP layer. Unlike the underlying
procurement APIs, these routes:

  * exclude already-received lines,
  * compute `remaining_incoming_quantity` server-side,
  * aggregate warehouse allocations by warehouse_code (no SPO leakage),
  * never expose `quantity_received`, `quantity_rejected`, `receipt_status`,
  * never expose internal UUIDs, SPO numbers, picking-line identifiers, or inbound_shipment_lines_id.

See `next_agents/incoming_stock_enquiries.txt` for the source rules and `app/services/
incoming_stock_service.py` for the implementation.
