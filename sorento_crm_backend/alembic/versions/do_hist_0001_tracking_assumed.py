"""orders.tracking_assumed_at: a DO the history backfill assumed delivered (DO-HISTORY).

Set by the DO ingest when an AutoCount DO dated before `DO_ASSUME_DELIVERED_BEFORE` lands with no
Order Tracking, together with the delivered status; `actual_delivery_date` stays empty (owner,
13 Oct 2026). Cleared by a later Overall Tracking row for that DO. It is also the revert key.

Additive and nullable, no default, nothing backfilled.
