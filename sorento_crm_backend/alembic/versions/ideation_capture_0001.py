"""Publish the `ideate_extractor` no-problem rule to the live prompt registry.

The fallback template gained a rule: a message that only says the user wants to submit or
share an idea ("want to submit idea") has no problem, so the extractor leaves problem empty
instead of inventing one. `get_prompt` serves the fallback only when the `production` label
has no row, and `seed_prompt_registry` never updates a live row, so a seeded install keeps the
old text. This migration publishes the new text as the next immutable version and moves the
label, but ONLY when production is still a previous stock fallback (`STOCK_IDEATE_EXTRACTOR_TEXTS`,
compared strip-normalised). A template the owner edited is left alone with a warning, and a
re-run is a no-op because production then equals the fallback. The seed runs first so the
`ideation_capture_*` copy keys exist; it also gives a fresh database a row to compare against.
