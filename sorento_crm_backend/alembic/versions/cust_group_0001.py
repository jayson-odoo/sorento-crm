"""CUSTOMER-GROUP: `customer_groups` and `customers.customer_group_id`. DDL only.

Revision ID: cust_group_0001
Revises: picker_no_cap_0001
Create Date: 2026-10-02

A group is one company's customer made of several ledgers, and only the office puts a ledger
in one (owner ruling 3 Oct 2026: no automatic name-matching joins, explicit links only).

This revision used to seed groups on upgrade by joining ledgers whose names looked alike
(`ledger_family_key`). It no longer does: upgrade creates the table and the column and
assigns NO customer to any group. The revision id and chain are unchanged, so a database
that already ran the old body (dev) stays at the same head; its seeded rows are left as they
are. `plan_groups` stays as a pure helper for `scripts/customer_groups_seed_sql.py`, which
prints a proposal for the owner to review; nothing here calls it.
Additive: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, the FK only when absent.
