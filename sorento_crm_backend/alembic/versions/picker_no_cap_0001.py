"""chatbot pickers no longer capped at 10: roster_cap starts at the S3 ceiling, 50

PICKER-NO-CAP (owner, 2 Oct 2026: "the chatbot picker is capped at 10 options, notably
in the incoming search. Remove that cap"; crew answer (c), PR #1436). The setting stays
(`chatbot_entity_kinds.roster_cap`, owner ruling 20 Sep 2026) and so does its ceiling of
50 (security review S3, `api/v1/system/chatbot_config.py`). Only the starting value
moves: the server default goes from 10 to 50, and every row still at the old default 10
moves to 50. A row the owner set to any other number keeps it. The resolver returns at
most 20 to 25 matches per typed word, so in practice nothing is cut.

Row content, but no `seed_chatbot_policy` replay is needed: `policy_rows.py`'s seed
rows carry 50 themselves, and the model's `server_default` carries it for `create_all`.
