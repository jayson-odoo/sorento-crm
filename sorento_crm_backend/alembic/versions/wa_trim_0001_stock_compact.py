"""Every chatbot contact gets the COMPACT stock view (WA-MSG-TRIM, owner 3 Oct 2026).

Since 1 Oct 2026 Meta charges every outgoing WhatsApp message, and the detailed view (one
row per location) is what pushes a stock answer past the chunk limit into extra messages.
Every ``stock_visibility_policies`` row in ``detailed`` becomes ``compact``: the global
default (seeded ``detailed`` by 416), access-type rows and contact overrides alike, so no
tier can still hand a contact the detailed view. ``availability`` is the separate dealer
mode and is never touched.

Pure data, no schema change on the policy table. The ids it flipped are kept in
``stock_visibility_wa_trim_backup`` so the downgrade restores exactly those rows, and not
a row an admin set to ``compact`` on purpose (a flipped row an admin later re-saves as
``compact`` still goes back, the backup cannot tell the two apart). The backup table has
no model; ``alembic/env.py`` ``MIGRATION_ONLY_TABLES`` keeps autogenerate from proposing
to drop it. Idempotent: a second run finds no
``detailed`` row and the backup insert skips ids it already holds.

Plan: ``documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-wa-msg-trim.md``.
