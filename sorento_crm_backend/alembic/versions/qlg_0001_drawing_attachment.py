"""The technical drawing a quotation line goes out with (QUOTATION-UX, AC-QLG08 / AC-QLG10).

`projects.quotation_lines.drawing_attachment_id` is the drawing twin of `image_attachment_id`:
the "Technical Specifications" image a salesperson picked for the line, or, once the version is
issued, the one the customer was sent (the issue freeze fills it, never overwrites it). Nullable,
because a draft line with no pick resolves its drawing live off the product.

ON DELETE SET NULL, like `image_attachment_id`: hard-deleting a file must not take the quotation
line with it.

No backfill: nothing records which drawing a line was quoted with before this column, so every
existing row starts NULL and reads the product's first drawing live, which is what the screen
showed before.
