"""chatbot turn re-architecture S12: the hand-set config ships with the deploy

Owner ruling, 21 Sep 2026 (hand pass 12): deploying this lane must need NO hand setup
on prod. Two kinds of state were being carried by hand on the clone and would not have
travelled with the deploy at all.

**Narrowing.** Three values the owner set on the Chatbot Domains page while hand-testing
are the seed now (`app/services/chatbot/turn/policy_rows.py` carries the same three, and
this migration carries them onto an already-seeded database):

  * `order.product`: `optional_filter` -> `list_all`. An order ask naming a product
    lists every variant instead of filtering to one code.
  * `promotion.product`: `optional_filter` -> `narrow_by_tier`.
  * `product_attachment.product`: `must_narrow_one` -> `narrow_by_tier`.

Each is a jsonb `||` merge on that domain's own key, so every other key in the object
(and every other domain) is untouched. All three stay editable on the Chatbot Domains
page; this only moves where the value comes from on a fresh deploy.

**The parser prompt.** `chatbot_rearch_s4` publishes the rendered policy blocks as a NEW
version and deliberately leaves the `production` label where it was, so that promoting
was one reviewed click on the Prompts page. That rule is REVERSED here and for later
publishes in this lane: the blocks are derived from the policy tables, this migration
has just changed three of them, and a deploy that leaves `production` pointing at a
version whose blocks disagree with the tables is a deploy that ships config nobody can
see took effect. So S12 republishes through s4's own `publish_policy_blocks` (never a
second copy of the body formula) and then MOVES the label onto the version whose
template is exactly what today's tables render.

The version id `production` pointed at before the move is recorded on the promoted
version's `config_json` (`s12_prior_production_version_id`), which is what lets
`downgrade()` put the label back on the version it actually came from rather than on
merely some older one. `config_json` is the row's own reserved config slot and the
`template` (the immutable half of the registry contract) is never touched.

Idempotent throughout: the narrowing merges are no-ops on a second run, s4's publish
skips when the full rendered template is already published, and the label move is
skipped (and the prior id therefore not re-recorded) when `production` already points at
the target version.

`downgrade()` restores the three pre-S12 narrowing values and returns the label to the
recorded version. It does NOT delete the version this published: the registry is
append-only, and s4's own `downgrade()` is what removes an unlabelled blocks version if
the chain is unwound that far.
