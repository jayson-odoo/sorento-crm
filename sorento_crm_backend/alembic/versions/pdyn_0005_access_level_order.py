"""Owner answer 6 (2 Oct 2026), access levels, APPROVED: the active contact access types take
the order the owner's parser prompt lists them in, so `{{access_levels}}` renders his text.

Only `sort_order` of ACTIVE rows with these exact names changes; nothing is inserted,
renamed or deactivated, and an inactive row keeps its order. Re-running is a no-op.
Chained before the wording-layer migrations (pdyn_0002, pdyn_0003) so they render the
aligned order. Agents and the master_products narrowing (also answer 6) are on hold.
