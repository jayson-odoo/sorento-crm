"""Widen three `customers` columns to the lengths the model has always declared.

The model was always the intent; the database had drifted below it. `app/models/order.py`
declares `phone_number` String(50), `industry` String(120) and `website` String(500), and the
live column was `varchar(20)`, `varchar(100)` and `varchar(255)`. Nothing in the codebase
asked for the narrower widths - they are the residue of an earlier shape that a later model
edit never carried into a migration.

Found by a real 4,196-row AutoCount debtor export: 58 rows carry a `Phone 1` longer than 20
characters (`016-978 5508 (MR.CHAEH)`, `09-5668833/013-9800123`). The importer's over-length
pre-check read the MODEL's lengths, so every one of those rows passed the preview and was then
rejected by Postgres at apply time with `StringDataRightTruncation` - a preview promising 0
failures followed by 58 `upsert_error` rows. The importer now reads its limits from the
database (see `customer_import_service.column_limits`) and `tests/test_customers_schema_drift.py`
fails on any future divergence, so this revision resets the clock and the guard keeps it.

Widening only, so it is non-destructive: every value that fits `varchar(20)` fits
`varchar(50)`, and Postgres does not rewrite the table for a varchar length increase.

**The downgrade can truncate.** It narrows the same three columns back, which Postgres refuses
outright if any stored value is longer (and would silently mean data loss if it did not). Run
it only on a database where those columns are known to be within the old widths.
