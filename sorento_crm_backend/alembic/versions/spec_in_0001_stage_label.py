"""Call the project funnel's "Specified" rung "Spec In", and let it step back to Registered.

Owner hand-test, 13 Oct: the stage is "Spec In" (spec = specification, the trade's own
phrase; migration 324 already renamed the edge into it to "Spec in"), and a project moved
to Spec In by mistake had no way back - the only backward edge into Registered's
neighbourhood was Quoted -> Spec In. The seed writes labels and edges only when it creates
the funnel, so existing installs need this.

Default graph only (scope_id NULL): a template's forked graph made its own choices. Matched
on the seeded wording, so an admin who already renamed the rung or the edge keeps their own
words. The back edge is added only where both rungs exist and only once, so re-running
changes nothing. The downgrade removes only a "Back to registered" edge on the exact Spec In
-> Registered pair; an admin edge with that same label on that same pair cannot be told
apart from ours and would go with it.
