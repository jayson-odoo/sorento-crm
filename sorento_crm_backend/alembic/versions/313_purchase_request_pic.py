"""Add PIC (person in charge) to purchase requests / sponsorship forms.

There was nowhere on the form to record the person receiving the delivery, so
staff typed them onto the end of the delivery address:

    2, Lebuh Cecil, Ghaut, 10300 George Town, Pulau Pinang Contact: Hanson (012-403 9611)

which makes the address two facts in one column - unreadable programmatically and
easy to miss when scanning the printed form.

Deliberately ONE free-text column rather than pic_name + pic_phone: real values
are messy ("Hanson (012-403 9611)", "Hanson / Ali 012-4039411", a name with no
number at all), nothing downstream parses it, and the field is explicitly
optional - two required-shaped columns would just invite empty halves. The
structured path already exists as ``requested_by_contact_id``.

No backfill: historical rows keep their contact embedded in the address. Parsing
it back out is guesswork and would silently corrupt addresses it got wrong.
