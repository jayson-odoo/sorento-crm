"""CHATBOT-SELFREF-SCOPE B1: the n8n integration role may read the sales reports.

Revision ID: selfref_0001_n8n_sales_view
Revises: oihr_0004_wide_line_table
Create Date: 2026-09-30

Production, 30 Sep 2026: "what is my sales this month" picked `crm_sales_analysis`, whose
route (`app/api/v1/sales/analysis.py`) is gated on `sales.reports.view` for the act-as
principal of the caller's API key. `sales_s1_reports_module` granted that slug to
`superadmin` and `admin` only, so the n8n key's principal (role `integration_n8n`) was
answered 403 and the customer read "Could not run the sales report right now."
`375_scm_proforma_invoice` is the precedent the other way round (an integration role
deliberately excluded from an OPERATOR permission); this one is a READ the chatbot makes on
the contact's behalf, and the contact's own reveal key stays the gate on the data.

Idempotent: the permission row is created if a create_all database lacks it, and the grant
is `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. `scripts.bootstrap_env` seeds the same grant for a database
built without migration bodies (CI).
