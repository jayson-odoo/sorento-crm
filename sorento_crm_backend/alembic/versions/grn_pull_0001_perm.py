"""Permission for the Goods Receive Notes pull from AutoCount (PLAN-autocount-grn-pull-crm-02oct.md).

`procurement.grn.autocount_pull` is swept onto every role that already holds the sibling
`procurement.grn.import` permission (P13, the owner ruling `522_autocount_pull_perms` and
`do_pull_0001_perm` applied: the pull is another way to bring in the same book, so whoever
could already import GRNs may pull them instead), integration roles excluded. `admin` is
granted explicitly too.
