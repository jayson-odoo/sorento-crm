"""Backfill company_id on conversation_frame embeddings (SCOPE-FRAMES, finding 1) and
re-embed the certificates that carry another company's product codes (finding 3).

Until this lane the embedding worker wrote every `conversation_frame` document and chunk
company-less, and a company-less row is visible under every company scope, so a
contact-scoped `/external/rag/search` could read every company's contact conversation
summaries. A company-scoped search now returns no frame at all, and the worker stamps the
frame contact's company as defence in depth; this backfill gives the existing rows the same
stamp.

Additive UPDATE only: NULL -> the company of the frame's contact, when the contact
belongs to exactly one company (the same resolution the worker uses,
`embedding_worker.backfill_frame_embedding_companies`). Every other row stays NULL.

Certificates: the worker now embeds only the codes of the certificate's own company's
products (a shared certificate: company-less products only). An embedding written before
that keeps the other companies' codes until it is rebuilt, so every certificate that has an
embedding is queued for a rebuild (the table is small, and today's links cannot tell which
embedding was built from a link or product company since changed); the scheduler's
embedding drain picks the rows up. Plan:
documentation/plans/security/PLAN-embedding-scope-frames-12oct.md.
