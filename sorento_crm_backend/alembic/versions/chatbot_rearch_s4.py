"""Publish the first re-architecture parser version, with the policy blocks in its body.

Chatbot turn re-architecture S4 (AC-1550). One NEW version of
``chatbot_semantic_parser``, UNLABELLED, whose body is the ``SEMANTIC_PARSER_PROMPT``
constant with the domain and entity-kind blocks rendered from ``chatbot_domains`` /
``chatbot_entity_kinds`` appended between two markers, and whose ``config_json`` carries
the sha256 of exactly those blocks.

Amended 16 Sep 2026 (AC-1317, D8 "one prompt lineage"): the base used to be whatever
``production`` pointed at today, so a published version could drift from
``SEMANTIC_PARSER_PROMPT`` - the constant itself gained an owner ruling that it is CRM
content now, not a byte-fidelity-locked n8n import, which retired the reason for
preferring the live DB row over it. The constant is now the ONE COPY of the output-keys
declaration (edit it there, not here or in the schema's prose) - this migration derives
its base FROM the constant every time, so publishing can never carry a stale OUTPUT
block forward.

The ``production`` label is NOT moved. That is the whole shape of this registry and the
reason the blocks are rendered at publish time rather than per turn: deploying this
changes nothing about how a live turn is parsed, and promoting it is one label move the
owner makes on the Prompts page once they have read the diff. AC-1552's staleness banner
compares ``config_json["blocks_hash"]`` against the rows as they stand today, so a domain
saved after this publish reads as "domain block out of date" instead of silently
rewriting a version somebody already graded.

Idempotent: a version whose FULL rendered template (constant plus policy blocks)
already matches today's is left alone - not just a `blocks_hash` match, since the
constant can change (a new output key, a wording fix) without the policy tables moving
at all.
