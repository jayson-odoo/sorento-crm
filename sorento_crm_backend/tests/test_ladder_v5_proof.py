"""The five-row proof, and the table it is checked against (ladder v5, section 1e).

`tests/scm/test_ladder_v5.py` pins what the ENGINE composes. This file pins what a planner
READS: the four questions plus Buy, each answered Yes or No with the deciding figure inside
the sentence, and the cell's location table beneath them.

One test per criterion, each with the captain's own case where he gave one:

* **AC-V1** five rows, in order, every one answered, and none of them named Incoming;
* **AC-V3** a cited other-group site brings its WHOLE group, each row with its own signed
  available and the subtotal carrying `donor_group_net`;
* **AC-V4** question 3 offers the donor now that the cross-group cap is gone (v7.1, R5),
  and the suggestion note never claims borrowing is possible where the proof says nothing
  is left;
* **AC-V5** question 4 is never proposed and names the donors it did not take from;
* **AC-V6** dealer hot-selling refuses the whole pile, DC1 and MWH included;
* **AC-V7** the pool is asked before another location: 24 needed, 268 free in the pile, 100
  at another group within the cap - the answer is Pool 24;
* **AC-V8** a line with no decision shows the LIVE suggestion, stamped with today's ladder.

Postgres via `blank_session`, every FK target seeded here. Helpers come from the board's
own suite so the two files cannot come to disagree about what a board looks like.
