"""S6 of the quotation DOCUMENT layer: rendering an ISSUE to the real artifact's layout.

Written BEFORE the implementation. The rules asserted here are the ones that make the PDF a
record rather than a report:

- **It renders from the ISSUE SNAPSHOT.** The lines come from the ``version_id`` each
  ``project_quotation_issue_scopes`` row recorded, and the letter, terms and grand total come off
  the issue row. A re-download next year must be what was sent, so the test issues, then edits
  everything reachable, then re-renders and asserts nothing moved.
- **A rate-only line prints the words and counts nothing** (AC-C2 / AC-D3). The sample workbook
  carries five. Printing RM 0.00 for them, or adding them up, are both money bugs the reader
  cannot see.
- **A band label heads its section once** (AC-C3), which is what lets a QS line the PDF up
  against their own bill of quantities.
- **The PRODUCT IMAGE column collapses when no line has one** (AC-F4): a column of blank cells
  on every page is worse than no column.

Postgres only, via ``blank_session``. Every row carries the ``zzt-qpdf`` marker, because the dev
database this runs against holds a copy of production data.
