"""Ladder v5 edges the captain's own walk-through (`PLAN-scm-cs-planning-uat.md` 1e) and the
two proof files (`tests/scm/test_ladder_v5.py`, `tests/test_ladder_v5_proof.py`) do not
already pin: a cap that genuinely binds rather than being trivially exceeded, the whole-line
rule's own sentence on the question that HAD stock, a late SPO's overdue days as the trail and
the drill-down table each treat them, a decided line carrying a frozen incoming component
beside a stale suggestion stamp, a payload-wide scan for leaked rung vocabulary, the other-group
block's zero-holding sibling and its exact arithmetic, and the query-count bound on a big board.

TESTER'S BRIEF: pin current behaviour. Where a fixture in the brief describes something the
ladder's own rules (as ruled in section 1e) make impossible - a PARTIAL cross-group take, for
one - the docstring says so and the test asserts what the code actually does instead, never
what the brief assumed.

    on, rather than the existing pin's donor of 500 against a cap of 10 (a huge margin).

    Donor net 100, cap (qty) 20, need 24: the donor could very nearly cover the whole line
