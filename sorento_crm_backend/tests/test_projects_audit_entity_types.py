"""The projects module's audit entity types are pinned to the PRE-move table names.

``audit_service._audit_entity_type`` derives ``audit_log.entity_type`` from
``__tablename__`` unless the model overrides it. Migration 354 renamed 34 tables, so
without an override two things break at once and neither raises:

* every audit row already written for `project_leads` is orphaned, because new rows arrive
  as `leads` and nothing joins the two;
* the module starts writing `entity_type='brands'`, `'purchase_orders'`,
  `'sales_orders'`, which core `app.models.product` and `app.models.procurement` already
  use, so a "who changed this brand" query returns another module's history.

Both failures are silent - the write succeeds, the report is wrong - which is exactly the
kind of thing that has to be pinned by a test rather than by a convention. Two services
also hardcode the old strings (`project_lead_service.LEAD_AUDIT_ENTITY_TYPE`,
`project_task_service`'s `AuditLog.entity_type == "project_tasks"` filter), and they are
correct only while this holds.

The pre-move names come from migration 354's own table list, so the migration and the
models cannot drift apart on the question of what a table used to be called.
