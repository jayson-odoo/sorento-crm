"""AI-EXTRACT-DYM: a misread product code carries "did you mean" suggestions
the user confirms; nothing is ever auto-applied.

See documentation/plans/dealer-kit/PLAN-ai-extract-dym.md and
ai-extract-dym-acceptance-criteria.md (AC-B1..B8).

Drives `AIExtractService._extract_products(parsed)` on a real Postgres session,
the same seam `test_ai_extract_resolver_match.py` uses, so the resolver's own
trigram neighbours, company scope and the active filter are all real. The four
codes are the owner's real misreads from the 9 Oct sales order screenshot.
