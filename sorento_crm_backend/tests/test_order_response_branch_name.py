"""DO-BRANCH-NAME (owner, 13 Oct 2026): the synced `orders.branch_name` reaches the wire.

`GET /api/v1/order-management/orders` (and the single GET) serialise through `OrderResponse`;
a field it does not declare is silently dropped, which is why neither the chatbot DO list nor
the DO screens could show the branch. The value is AutoCount-owned, so it is read-only: it is
on the response, never on the create or update body.
