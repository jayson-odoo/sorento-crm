"""What raised each row - the actual `order_inquiry_raises` event, not the row's own
"who currently owns it" coalesce (PLAN-oi-decision-trail-ui.md, AC-DT-3).

SO390524 / OI-2609-0731 (prod, 25 Sep 2026): the row's own `raised_at` is its birth, and
the `order_inquiry_raises` event that actually raised it lands a beat later - a measured
1.3-second gap - so the match has to be a WINDOW, never an equality.
