"""RED tests for ingest parity standardisation, Phase S3 (shipping order rules).

UAC: documentation/plans/autocount/ingest-parity-standardisation-acceptance-criteria.md
     Phase S3, AC-P3-1 .. AC-P3-8.
PLAN: documentation/plans/autocount/PLAN-ingest-parity-standardisation.md sections 2.5, 2.6.

Substrate: `blank_session()` throughout. Unlike Phase S2's outstanding-upload
tests, none of the drivers used here (`SPOAllocationService.upsert_allocation`,
`ShippingOrderIngestService`, `outstanding_import_service._spo_lines_to_close`)
touch `outstanding_reader`/`import_field_alias`, so no migration-seeded data
is needed.

Model facts verified in code before relying on them:

* `app/tasks/import_tasks.process_spo_import` (the RQ task) parses rows, then
  hands each `(product, warehouse)` group to
  `SPOAllocationService.upsert_allocation(allocation_data, user_id,
  forward_match=False)` - THIS is "the function it calls with parsed rows",
  reused directly here (matching `tests/test_spo_import_upsert.py`'s own
  pattern) rather than driving the whole RQ task. After the group loop, the
  task calls `forward_match_grn_lines_for_spo_best_effort` once per
  `(spo_number, company_id)` touched - CORRECT already on the xlsx path; only
  `ShippingOrderIngestService` (grep: zero hits for `forward_match`) lacks it.
* `_spo_import_extract_container` (`app/tasks/import_tasks.py`) is NARROWER
  than the shared function AC-P3-2 wants: it is "text after the first space"
  only, so `"F-WHSU8488069 (MOCHA)"` -> `"(MOCHA)"` (wrong) and
  `"TRHU4104785"` (no space at all) -> `None` (wrong, no fallback to the
  whole string). The golden-set test therefore targets the NEW shared
  `app.services.rules.shipping_order_rules.extract_container_number`, not
  this narrower existing function.
* `SPOAllocation` (`app/models/procurement.py`) has NO `container_number`
  column (grep, zero hits) - confirmed structurally.
* `get_inbound_shipment_by_container_number` (`app/api/v1/external/utils.py`)
  already exists and is reusable by both writers (case-insensitive, ordered
  by `created_at` for a non-unique container).
* `SPOAllocationService.upsert_allocation`'s existing-row query explicitly
  filters `SPOAllocation.source_system.is_(None)` - it can ONLY adopt a
  pre-existing xlsx-era row, NEVER one an ESB push wrote (`source_system=
  'autocount'`). `outstanding_import_service._spo_lines_to_close` filters
  `source_system == SPO_UPLOAD_SOURCE` for the same reason - an ESB-written
  open row is invisible to the close-by-absence sweep. Both are AC-P3-5.
* `ShippingOrderIngestService._line_values` never sets `inbound_shipment_id`
  at all - `CanonicalShippingOrderLine`/`CanonicalShippingOrder` have no
  container-bearing field yet, so there is nothing to resolve a shipment
  from.
* `ShippingOrderIngestService._write_row` does a blind `setattr` for every
  line column, including `allocated_quantity` and `quantity_received` (the
  latter recomputed from the PUSHED payload's own `qty_received`, default
  `0`) - there is no received-quantity guard on this path at all, unlike
  `SPOAllocationService.upsert_allocation`'s `AllocationReceivedGuardError`
  (already correct on the xlsx path).
* `document_ingest_service`'s existing D5 refusal
  (`doc_family(payload.po_number) == FAMILY_SPO` -> refuse, "push under
  shipping_orders") is PREFIX-ONLY; `CanonicalPurchaseOrder` has no
  `is_shipping_order` field, so a payload naming one fails on `extra="forbid"`
  today rather than being refused for the DOCUMENTED reason.
* `CanonicalShippingOrder.status` is still required
  (`_CanonicalDocument.status: str = Field(..., ...)`).
* **Chosen module for the two PLAN-2.5 pure functions this file cannot yet
  exercise behaviourally** (`link_allocation_to_shipment`,
  `relink_allocations_for_container`): `app.services.rules
  .shipping_order_rules`, per the coordinator's instruction - stated here so
  the choice is visible to the coder.
