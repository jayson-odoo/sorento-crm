"""What an edit to a warehouse must actually persist, and answer with.

Three defects live here, and all three are invisible to the frontend tests, which mock the
mutation and so stop at the hook boundary:

* ``update_warehouse`` applied the payload and committed without touching ``updated_at``,
  and the column carries no ``onupdate``. So the detail header's "Last Updated" showed the
  creation date forever, no matter how many times the record was edited.
* Clearing "Draws stock from" has to write NULL. The only test proving that mocked the
  mutation, so a later "strip nulls from the payload" change on either side would silently
  restore the user-reported bug (a pool can be changed but never unset) with nothing red.
  Both transitions are covered here: set a pool, and clear one.
* The RESPONSE to that edit has to agree with itself. ``pool_warehouse_code`` is not a
  mapped column - it is a plain attribute that ``_attach_pool_codes`` hangs on the instance
  for display - so neither ``commit()`` nor ``refresh()`` touches it, and whatever the read
  at the top of ``update_warehouse`` attached survives the write. Clearing a pool therefore
  answered ``pool_warehouse_id: null`` beside the OLD code, and setting one answered the new
  id beside a stale null. One response contradicting itself, in the one field the screen
  actually renders (the id is a UUID and never shown). Both directions are pinned below.

Postgres only, against a blank copy of the real schema (``blank_session``). Nothing is
borrowed from an existing row: ``warehouse_code`` is globally unique, and CI's database is
empty, so every warehouse this file needs is seeded here with a marker-prefixed code.
