"""Portal AI extract runs off the event loop
(documentation/plans/ai-extract/PLAN-ai-extract-off-the-loop.md,
documentation/plans/ai-extract/ai-extract-off-the-loop-acceptance-criteria.md).

`app/api/v1/public/ai_extract.py::ai_extract` used to be `async def` and called
the synchronous `AIExtractService.extract` (PDF render plus LLM round trip,
measured 5.8 to 9.8 s per image) inline, on the event loop, freezing every
other concurrent request on that gunicorn worker. Same class of defect fixed
for the dealer-kit flyer read in PR #164
(`documentation/plans/dealer-kit/PLAN-flyer-read-hardening.md`).

* AC-1 - the extract call runs off the event loop (pinned by shape, not a
  wall clock).
* AC-2 - the loop stays responsive to a second request while an extract is in
  flight, proven by request ORDERING rather than elapsed time.
* AC-3 - no route mounted under `/api/v1/public/portal/ai-extract*`, and not
  `product_specifications.preview_spec_search` (the branch's second fix), is a
  coroutine endpoint.
* AC-4 - upload bytes reach the service intact via the sync `f.file.read()`
  path (checked inside the AC-1 test).

Same shape as PR #164's AC-J2/AC-J3 dealer-kit tests.

Postgres only (`tests/_pg_fixture.blank_session`), rows seeded by the test
with a `ZZT-` marker prefix.

        of "off the loop or not" never is.

        AC-4 rides along here: two files are uploaded and the spy records what
        it actually received. This pins the ``await f.read()`` ->

        asserts itself (a failure there would surface as a bare 500, not a
