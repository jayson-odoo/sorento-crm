"""Regression guards for the security review of ingest-parity-standardisation
S3 (shipping orders) and its D17 warehouse-adoption rule, 2026-09-06.

Each test pins ONE defect the review found, named `test_sec_<n>_...` to match
the review report:

  sec 1  (blocker 1) `ShippingOrderIngestService._adopt_lines` never ran
         `received_guard` at all - a legacy xlsx-era row with a real receipt
         could be adopted by an incoming line whose `qty_received` regresses
         below it, erasing the receipt (`receipt_status` back to `pending`,
         supply re-enters `scm.on_order_v`).
  sec 2  (blocker 2) the GRN forward-match sweep ran INSIDE
         `ShippingOrderIngestService.ingest()`, before the route's own
         `db.commit()` - `forward_match_grn_lines_for_spo` commits on success
         and rolls back on failure, so one exception mid-batch discarded
         every not-yet-committed record while the route still answered 200.
  sec 3  (should-fix 3) `relink_allocations_for_container` had no company
         filter - a container shared by two companies could relink company
         B's allocations to company A's shipment.
  sec 4  (should-fix 4) `WarehouseService.create_warehouse` silently ADOPTED
         a case/whitespace variant, overwriting every `WarehouseBase` default
         on the existing row while still answering 201.

Substrate: `tests._pg_fixture.blank_session()`, same as the S3 file - a real
Postgres schema built from the live models, freshly created and rolled back
per test.
