"""S4 sponsorship-to-project link (UAC Group F, AC-F3 to AC-F7).

One form, not two (AC-F3): `purchase_requests` gains a nullable `project_id`, and every
existing sponsorship keeps working untouched.

The rollout is per CONTACT (AC-F4), which is the point of the whole design: Sorento wants
to require a registered project from the salespeople they have trained, without breaking
the form for everybody else on the same day. So the rules under test are:

- an UNFLAGGED contact submits exactly as before, with or without a project;
- a FLAGGED contact cannot submit without one (AC-F5, hard block, deliberately chosen
  over an inline registration modal and over a free-text fallback);
- a project belonging to a company the contact is NOT linked to is refused, because the
  picker only offers the ones they are (AC-F4a) and the server cannot trust the client;
- the block lives in the SERVICE, not in the browser: the portal FE is not a trust
  boundary.
