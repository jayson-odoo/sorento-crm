"""RED tests for hiding retired SPO allocation lines (AC-H1..AC-H6, AC-H8, AC-H10..AC-H14, AC-H17, AC-H19).

UAC: documentation/plans/autocount/hide-retired-spo-lines-acceptance-criteria.md
PLAN: documentation/plans/autocount/PLAN-hide-retired-spo-lines.md

Written test-first (Phase 2), before `spo_supply.visible_line_clauses()` exists.
Contract this suite pins:

- `app.services.scm.spo_supply.visible_line_clauses()` - one predicate: a line is
  VISIBLE unless `retired_at IS NOT NULL AND coalesce(quantity_received, 0) = 0`
  (R1/R2). A retired line that carries a receipt (R2) or a line closed for any
  other reason (fully received, R1) stays visible.
- Every DISPLAY reader in `app.services.procurement_service` applies it:
  `list_allocations`, `list_documents` (+ its `total_allocated`/`total_received`
  rollups), `get_document` (+ its own rollups) (R4, R6).
- A read that resolves an allocation BY ITS OWN ID - here, a GRN's picking line
  pointing at a retired allocation - is NOT filtered (R3).
- Line balance follows outstanding status, hidden or not: a line that is not
  outstanding reads `balance == 0` (R5), so the grid can never disagree with the
  document header again.

Substrate reused from `tests.scm.test_spo_allocation_documents` (the `scm_app`
Postgres-savepoint fixture, its `_client`/`_chain`/`_product` catalogue helpers
and `DOCUMENTS_URL`) rather than re-copied, per the tester brief. Allocation rows
here carry `retired_at`/`source_system`, which that module's own `_line` helper
does not accept, so this file adds its own `_alloc`.

        """AC-H17 (revised, round 5). A shipment line whose product has one
        visible allocation (10) and one retired, zero-receipt allocation
        (999) with an `inbound_shipment_id` on the SAME shipment: the
        packing-list RESPONSE recomputes both `spo_allocated_quantity` and
        `line_status` from the VISIBLE set only. `quantity_shipped` is
        chosen (50) so the filtered total (10) and the unfiltered total
        (1009) fall in DIFFERENT status branches of
        `compute_inbound_shipment_line_status` - filtered:
        `quantity_shipped(50) > allocated(10)` -> `partially_allocated`;
        unfiltered: `quantity_shipped(50) <= allocated(1009)` and
        `received(0) == 0` -> `allocated` - so an ungated status cannot pass
        by coincidence.

        `refresh_shipment_line_statuses`' PERSISTED column and status are
        deliberately NOT filtered (they feed the reorder engine's ask, not
        the screen), so the request is also asserted NOT to have narrowed
        the stored row: `inbound_shipment_lines.line_status`/
        `spo_allocated_quantity` read the UNFILTERED figures (1009 /
        "allocated") after the very request whose own RESPONSE reports the
        filtered ones (10 / "partially_allocated") - proving the fix lives
        only in the response, and catching a future over-filter that would
        silently starve the reorder engine's ask.

        RED today at the response assertions: `get_packing_list` persists
        `line_status` via `refresh_shipment_line_statuses`, whose own
        `totals_alloc` query carries no visibility filter, and the route
        never recomputes `line_status` afterwards - so the response shows
        `spo_allocated_quantity 10` (round 3's own fix, already filtered)
        against a `line_status` still computed from 1009, exactly the
        disagreement the AC names. The persisted-row assertions already
        pass today (nothing filters the write path at all yet); they are
        the guard against a future fix reaching too far.
