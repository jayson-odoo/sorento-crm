"""The recipient block becomes correctable on a PATCH.

Written BEFORE the implementation, so every test here is red until
``ProjectQuotationDocumentUpdate`` carries the three snapshot fields and
``update_document`` applies them.

Why this is a product decision and not a plumbing gap. AC-A3 snapshots the recipient off the
project's developer party ONCE, at creation, and deliberately never re-derives it, so that a
party record edited next year cannot rewrite a quotation the customer is already holding. The
client asked for the "To" block to be editable in the edit view, and that asks for something
different from re-deriving: a correction to THIS document's copy, e.g. the customer's finance
department taking delivery of invoices at a different address to the one on the developer party.
So the party stays untouched in both directions.

Two claims carry the weight:

- The fields have to reach the column. The service applies an explicit ALLOW-LIST rather than
  patching whatever arrives, so a field can be perfectly valid on the schema and still be
  silently dropped, which the FE reads as "the save worked and my edit vanished".
- A PATCH that omits them must leave them alone. The FE stages only the fields somebody typed
  into, so a request correcting only Your Ref arrives without any recipient key at all. Treating
  absent as null would blank the recipient off a quotation as a side effect of fixing a
  reference, and the party it was snapshotted from would no longer be there to recover it.

Postgres only, via ``blank_session``. Every row created here carries the ``zzt-qheaderedit``
marker so nothing in this file can touch the real data the dev database holds.
