"""S1 (#978) - the undo journal a board Confirm writes, and the board's `undo` field.

RED for Phase 2 of `documentation/plans/scm/PLAN-board-undo-last-confirm.md`. Nothing in
this file has an implementation yet:

* `projects.so_supply_decisions.undo_journal` (migration `undo_0001`) does not exist on the
  model, so every test that reads `decision.undo_journal` fails with an `AttributeError` -
  that is this file's "right reason" until the coder adds the column.
* `BoardOrderStanding.undo` (the board payload field) does not exist on the response schema,
  so a test reading `order["undo"]` off `GET .../fulfilment-planning/board` fails with a
  `KeyError` - `response_model` silently drops an undeclared field (see this repo's own
  lesson on that), so the field has to be declared on BOTH the schema and the service dict
  before it ever reaches the wire.

Postgres only, via `tests/_pg_fixture.py::blank_session` (through the `api` fixture this file
imports) except for the two batch-fork tests, which reuse
`tests/test_planning_change_apply_on_board.py`'s own `world`/`api` fixtures running on the
REAL local database (rolled back) because `scm.committed_v` is a view the blank scratch
schema does not carry. Every row is seeded behind the `ZZT` marker; nothing is borrowed from
an existing table.

Contract pinned here (Phase 1 contract doc, `boardUndoMock.ts`; PLAN "The design"):

    undo_journal: JSON list of {"seq": int, "op": "insert"|"update"|"delete",
                                 "table": "<schema>.<table>", "pk": "<id as string>",
                                 "old": {column: value} | null}

    board order.undo: null | {"revision_no": int, "confirmed_at": iso,
                               "confirmed_by_name": str,
                               "refusal": null | "linked" | "actioned"}

Review round (amended after S1/S2/S3 landed - reviewer + security-reviewer finding): the
refusal code `manual_link` is renamed `linked` and its predicate is no longer a raw
`auto=False AND linked_at > confirmed_at` timestamp comparison - `confirmed_at` is a
PYTHON `datetime.utcnow()` captured once near the top of `_write_decision`, while
`linked_at` is POSTGRES `now()` resolved at the link row's own INSERT, later in the same
request; the two clocks are not the same instant, so a step-3 borrow's own `auto=False`
link written milliseconds later in the SAME transaction could read `linked_at >
confirmed_at` too and be wrongly refused. `linked` instead asks whether the link's own id
is in THIS confirm's own journal insert set for `projects.order_inquiry_links` - if the
confirm itself wrote it, it is not purchasing acting after the fact, whatever the clocks
say.
