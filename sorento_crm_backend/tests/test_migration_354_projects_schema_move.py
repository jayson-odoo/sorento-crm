"""Migration 354 has to be a no-op on a fresh database and do the work on an old one.

The projects module's 47 tables move from the default schema into `projects`, and the 34
that carried the `project_` prefix drop it on the way (ADR-0011). A database built by
`create_all` from the post-move models arrives with the tables already there and already
named; the shared development database arrives with all 47 sitting in `public` under their
old names. One revision serves both starting schemas, and every step is guarded on "the
source is there and the destination is not".

That guard is the whole revision, and it is the kind of thing never exercised until a
deploy: CI takes the no-op path, so a bug in the moving path ships, and a developer whose
database takes the moving path never sees the no-op path break. Both are run here.

The revision is imported and executed against a scratch schema pair rather than asserted
about the live database, per the pattern in CLAUDE.md and in
`test_migration_353_order_inquiry_rename.py`. Its `TARGET_SCHEMA` is rebound to the
fixture's scratch projects schema first: the module resolves its SOURCE schema from
`current_schema()` for the same reason, so neither end of the move can reach past the
scratch schemas into the real database and move production tables.
