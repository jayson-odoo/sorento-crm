"""C5 (code review round 3 batch 2): the supply sheet's own ladder options never got v8's
`gives_qty` / `reason`, so `SupplyLineCard` (through the shared `BoardLadderOptionsTable`)
rendered a blank Gives column - the board's OWN options (`BoardLadderOption`, R-K) already
carry both, and `_option_row` in `project_fulfilment_board_service.py` already computes
them; `_serialize_line` in `project_supply_service.py` simply never copied the two fields
across when v8 landed.

`response_model=SupplyProposal` silently drops an undeclared field (LESSONS-LEARNT), so this
is asserted on the JSON body, never on the internal dict.

Postgres via `tests/_pg_fixture.py::blank_session`, the fixture chain reused from
`tests/test_so_supply_confirmation.py`, per PRINCIPLES.
