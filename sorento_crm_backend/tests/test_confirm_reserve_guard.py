"""The confirm-time guard on a Reserve (R14, `PLAN-scm-planning-inline-decisions.md` D6).

The captain, 27 August 2026: the server refuses a reserve that exceeds what is ON HAND at a
location minus what OTHER lines have already confirmed there, and the message names the
location and the earlier order.

Why it is worth a rule of its own when the ladder already caps a proposal: the board lets a
planner COMPOSE an amendment by hand, and a hand-typed 15 against 10 on hand used to come
back as "BRW-AM now has 9 free for this line, and 15 was asked for" - true, and it does not
say who has the other one or where to go and look. The refusal now names SO383850.

The two cases the UAC pins (AC-E1, AC-E2): 15 asked holds the 9 left and records 6 short, 9
confirms in full. Since the owner rule of 12 Oct 2026 (OI-CLOSED-LINE) the guard no longer
refuses: the shortfall is a notice and only what is on hand less other holds is written.
