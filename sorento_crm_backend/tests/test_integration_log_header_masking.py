"""`integration_logs.request_headers` must never store a credential.

Every external endpoint that logs its own call copied the same two lines:
`dict(request.headers)` and then `if "x-api-key" in headers: headers["x-api-key"]
= "***"`. Exactly one key was masked, so `authorization`, `cookie`,
`x-chatbot-retry-key` and `proxy-authorization` landed in the table in plaintext,
readable by anyone who can read integration logs - once per customer message,
forever, because `chatbot.turns` and its logs are never pruned. `X-API-Key` and
`Authorization: Bearer` are BOTH accepted by `get_current_user_or_api_key`, so
which one an n8n HTTP node is configured with decided whether the secret was
kept.

There is now one helper and five callers, and this file is its guardrail: the
denylist test, the case-insensitivity test (HTTP header names are
case-insensitive and Starlette lowercases them, but a caller may pass a plain
dict), the substring rule that catches a header nobody has invented yet, and a
scan asserting no endpoint has gone back to hand-rolling it.

Pure functions and a source scan: no database, no HTTP, CI-safe.
