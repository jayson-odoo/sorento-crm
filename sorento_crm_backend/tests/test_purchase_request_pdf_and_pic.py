"""PR / SF printable PDF, and the PIC field.

Two problems this covers, both reported from production.

1. **Printing.** The only export was Excel. A long delivery address stretched one
   cell to an enormous width and the printed sheet was unusable — a data format
   doing a document's job. PR/SF now render a fixed-layout PDF through the same
   mechanism complaints and stock inquiries use, so "tidy" is the acceptance
   criterion, not a nice-to-have: a pathological address must WRAP inside its
   cell and never widen the table.

2. **PIC.** There was nowhere to record the person receiving the delivery, so
   staff typed them into the address:
   ``2, Lebuh Cecil, Ghaut, 10300 George Town, Pulau Pinang Contact: Hanson
   (012-403 9611)``. The address became two facts in one column. PIC is a
   separate, optional, free-text field, printed on the PDF.

PR and SF share one table and one detail component, so every assertion here runs
against BOTH request_type values — a field that works for one and not the other
is the regression this guards.
