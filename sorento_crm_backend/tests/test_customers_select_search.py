"""`/order-management/customers/select` can be SEARCHED and PAGED on the server.

It returned every active customer - 6,397 of them on the client's database - as whole ORM
rows, on every open of every customer dropdown in the product. The sales-order detail page
is where that finally showed: the select took seconds to open because the browser was being
handed the entire debtor master to filter locally.

Two properties, and the second is the one that makes this change safe to ship:

* `query` / `limit` / `offset` narrow and page it, the same shape
  `master_data/products_select.py` already uses;
* **omitting them still returns the whole list.** Two callers - the order-management
  customer select and the SCM filter bar - hold the full array and filter it in the browser,
  so a default limit would silently make customer 51 unreachable in both. Products could
  default to 100 because that is what THAT endpoint already returned unconditionally; this
  one already returned everything, so "everything" is what no arguments has to keep meaning.

Postgres only, on a blank scratch schema, every row marked so nothing here is confused with
the real debtor master.
