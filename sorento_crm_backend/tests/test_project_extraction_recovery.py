"""S20: a document read that is killed must end as failed, not sit on "running" for ever.

The bug this pins, reproduced on real data on 2026-08-08: a customer PO sat on screen as
"Waiting to be read", 10 pages, 0 lines, with a progress bar, indefinitely. The RQ
work-horse had been killed (signal 15) and RQ had correctly moved the job to its
FailedJobRegistry, but ``project_po_versions.extraction_state`` still said ``running``,
because the task writes its failure inside an ``except`` block and **an ``except`` block
never runs when the process is killed**.

So the detection cannot live inside the dying process. It lives in
``project_extraction_recovery_service``, which asks RQ what became of the job whose id the
row recorded. The three things worth pinning, and the reason each one is here:

1. **A killed read is reported.** The row ends ``failed`` with a sentence that says the
   read was interrupted, which is a different sentence from the one a document that
   genuinely could not be parsed gets. Telling somebody to re-scan a document that scans
   fine is advice that cannot help them.
2. **A long healthy read is NOT reported.** Extraction is one vision call per page,
   sequentially: ten pages measured at 166 seconds, so a forty page PO legitimately runs
   for over ten minutes. A reconciler that calls a live job dead is a worse bug than the
   one it fixes, so the decision is made from RQ's own answer about the job and never from
   the clock, wherever a job id exists to ask about.
3. **It can be retried**, on the same version, without touching the database by hand.

An RQ ``on_failure`` callback was the obvious mechanism and does NOT work here: in rq
2.6.1 ``execute_failure_callback`` is called from ``Worker.perform_job``, which runs INSIDE
the work-horse, and from ``StartedJobRegistry.cleanup``. ``monitor_work_horse``, the path
that actually handles a killed horse, calls ``handle_job_failure`` and never the callback.
A callback would have had exactly the same blind spot as the ``except`` block.

    """The bug measured on 2026-08-09 by killing a real work-horse.

    RQ's `JobStatus` is a `(str, Enum)`, so `__str__` is Enum's, not str's:
    `str(JobStatus.FAILED)` is "JobStatus.FAILED". Lowercased that is "jobstatus.failed",
    which is in neither `_ALIVE` nor `_DEAD`, so `_verdict` took its "an unrecognised
    status is not evidence of death" branch and left the row on `running` for ever - the
    exact stranding this module exists to remove, with RQ having correctly logged
    "moving job to FailedJobRegistry (signal 15)" a minute earlier.
