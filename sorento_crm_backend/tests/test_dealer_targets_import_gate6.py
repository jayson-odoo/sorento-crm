"""Dealer targets import, sixth real-file gate (lane SALES-TARGET-DEALER, crew 17 Oct, round 5).

Round 5 on the owner's 15 Oct prod backup, masked:
1. The dry-run script never installed the company scope listeners, so `company_scope(...)`
   filtered nothing and the name index held BOTH companies' customers: every tie paired an SRT
   ledger with its MCH twin, and two rows mapped to the other company. The import now names
   its one acting company and reads only that company's customers, whatever the listeners do.
2. A file name with a bracketed branch ("<NAME> (<branch>)") auto-mapped to the one ledger of
   that name, which has no such branch. Not exact, so it waits on a pick (owner ruling 16 Oct).
3. Three rows of one dealer all writing A/C I made one target list one ledger three times: the
   raw "An account is listed twice." is now a row reason naming the rows.
4. Masked OTHER reasons kept their words but x'd the row numbers, which are layout.
