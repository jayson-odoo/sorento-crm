"""Owner decision, 1 Oct 2026: the external ingest IGNORES fields it does not know.

The shared service adds a field when AutoCount grows one (SO-TRANSFERABLE was the case that
raised it). Until then `extra="forbid"` failed EVERY record of that entity on the first push
that carried the new key, so the two repos had to deploy in a fixed order. Now:

  * an unknown key is dropped, the record is ingested from the keys Sorento knows;
  * the unknown NAMES are logged once per request (never their values);
  * known fields keep their strict validation - a wrong type still fails the record.

Dropping is not writing: a key the schema does not declare reaches no column, so a payload
naming a CRM-owned annotation (`demand_class`, `internal_note` on a master) still cannot
touch it.
