"""Borrow donors, ranked by how little the borrow hurts them (PLAN 13.11).

The captain, reading a donor list that said only "MWH-IB 6990 free, 10 committed":

> "Here is the available donor. Before I decide to borrow, I need to know I am not hurting
>  them, so you need to let me know also what's their available, SO qty, SPO and PO qty,
>  and available quantity, and what's the impact of borrowing. I assume this list is ranked
>  by recommendation, is it?"

It was not ranked, and it stated free stock alone - which on this database is very nearly
raw on-hand, because free nets only reserved and confirmed holds and ignores the whole
outstanding book. So a donor with 6,990 free and 47,000 owed read as the safest one to take
from.

What is pinned here:

  * every donor carries AutoCount's own triple beside the engine's figures - `qty_on_hand`,
    `so_qty`, `spo_qty`, `available_qty` (SIGNED), `qty_free`, `qty_committed`;
  * the list is ORDERED by `available_after` (available less the whole of what this donor
    could give) descending, then by free descending, and the first one - and only the first
  - is `recommended`;
  * one builder serves both surfaces, so the sheet's donor list and the board's are the
    same list in the same order.

Postgres, blank scratch schema, every FK target seeded here (PRINCIPLES).
