"""HA-MONITOR: GET /api/v1/health, the outside monitor's probe of the backend.

On prod, `https://<CRM_DOMAIN>/health` is answered by nginx itself (200 text/plain
"healthy", crew probe 15 Oct), so a monitor on it stays green with the backend dead.
`/api/v1/*` is what nginx already sends to the backend, so the probe lives there.

It is unauthenticated and polled every minute from outside, so it must be cheap (one
`SELECT 1`) and say nothing beyond status + checks: no git sha, no prompt version, no
error text (a DB error can carry the host and user).
