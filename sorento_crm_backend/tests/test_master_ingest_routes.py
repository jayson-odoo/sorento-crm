"""Phase C - the ingest/read HTTP surface itself.

``test_master_ingest.py`` exercises ``MasterIngestService`` directly. That left
the *route* untested, and the gap hid a real defect: every ``AppException`` in
``ingest.py`` passed its message positionally into ``status_code`` and then
supplied ``status_code=`` again, so each guard raised ``TypeError: got multiple
values for argument 'status_code'`` and surfaced as a bare 500. The ESB was
therefore told "Sorento is broken" for what were plain client mistakes -- an
oversized batch and a malformed body are things the caller can fix, and a 500
tells it to retry forever instead.

These tests assert the contract at the HTTP boundary, where the ESB meets it:

  unknown entity      -> 404
  malformed body      -> 422
  batch over the cap  -> 413
  no company anchor   -> 422
  a good batch        -> 200 with a per-record verdict

Every body carries a ``companyCode`` since group A1: the six masters are
partitioned per company, so a push that names none has no correct destination.
The order of the guards is part of the contract and is asserted here -- a
malformed body is still 422 ``INVALID_BODY`` and an oversized batch still 413,
because a caller cannot fix an anchor in a request that never parsed.

Plus ``?dry_run=true``: a preview that resolves every record exactly as a real
ingest would -- adoption matching included -- and writes nothing. The assertion
that matters there is the *absence* of writes, not the presence of the flag.

    Postgres and not sqlite for the same reason ``test_master_ingest`` gives:
    the behaviour under test is SAVEPOINT and rollback semantics, which sqlite
    does not share.

    **Not ``_pg_fixture.pg_session``, and the difference is load-bearing here.**
    That helper builds its Session with SQLAlchemy's default
    ``join_transaction_mode="conditional_savepoint"``. Because the fixture's
    connection is in a transaction but not in a SAVEPOINT, that resolves to
    ``rollback_only`` -- under which ``session.rollback()`` rolls back the
    *entire outer transaction*, test setup included.

    The code under test calls ``session.rollback()``: it is how the dry run
    writes nothing. Under ``rollback_only`` the tests below would still have
    passed, but for the wrong reason -- "the dry run wrote nothing" would be
    indistinguishable from "the fixture discarded the whole test". For the
    single most important assertion in this feature, that ambiguity is
    unacceptable.

    ``create_savepoint`` gives the Session its own SAVEPOINT, so ``rollback()``
    discards exactly the session's own work and leaves the surrounding
    transaction intact -- which is what happens in production, where ``get_db``
    hands out a Session that owns its transaction outright.
