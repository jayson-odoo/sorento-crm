"""DO-APPLY-PROGRESS (documentation/plans/autocount/PLAN-do-apply-progress.md).

The Delivery Orders apply job sat on STARTED with Total 0 / Processed 0 / Successful 0 for
its whole run (6,487 documents, ~2m12s on dev): `_apply_delivery_orders` never published
progress, only the preview did. These pin AC-1..5 of
`do-apply-progress-acceptance-criteria.md`: the total goes out before the ingest, running
processed / successful / failed / skipped tallies go out during it through a session that
is NOT the apply's own (so the batch's single commit is untouched), a publish failure never
fails the apply, and the job row ends on the final numbers.

Reuses the DO pull suite's seeding helpers and SR1's `task_db` fixture (one connection, one
savepoint per session), so a progress write committed on the apply's own session would be
released past the apply's own rollback - which is what the kill test below catches.
