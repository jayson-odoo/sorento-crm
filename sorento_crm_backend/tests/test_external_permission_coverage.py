"""Every /external route enforces a permission - checked structurally.

A per-endpoint test can only cover the endpoints someone remembered to write a
test for. The failure mode that matters here is *omission*: a new router mounted
without a guard, reachable by any key holder, with nothing failing to say so.

These tests inspect the mounted application itself, so a route added tomorrow is
covered by construction.

#     onto a real app forces the flatten deterministically across versions.
