"""Order inquiries: one header per SO, hide cancelled, Was/Now after a redirect, cascade
skips used rows, raised-by per row (`PLAN-oi-worklist-one-header.md`,
`oi-worklist-one-header-acceptance-criteria.md`).

TEST-FIRST (Phase 2): written against the UAC + the plan's own measured facts, with NO
implementation to look at. Every test below must fail today for a real reason - a missing
function/attribute, or an assertion on behaviour the plan says does not exist yet - never an
import typo or a fixture bug.

Fixtures are borrowed, not re-invented, from the two suites the plan itself names as the
seam:

* `tests.test_order_inquiry_handshake` / `tests.test_order_inquiry_draft_links` for S1
  (cascade), S3 (one header) and S4 (Was/Now after a redirect) - the real-database,
  rolled-back `world`/`api` harness `_redirected_fixture` already builds the exact
  SO314593 shape (a row `partly_linked` to a document already fully received).
* `tests.test_order_inquiry_worklist` for S2 (raised-by) and S5 (hide cancelled) - the
  `blank_session`-backed `api` harness that already seeds one authored + one adopted order
  for the cross-project worklist.

Postgres only (`tests/_pg_fixture.py`), every FK seeded here or borrowed from an existing
seeding helper - never `LIMIT 1` off a shared table.
