"""A sales order's stock location is derived, never picked (owner hand test, PR #1264 note 3).

"each sales agent is assigned to a location group like BB then the stock location is
automatically BRW-BB". The chain the data already carries: the order's PO names an issuing
party, the party is a customer, the customer has a sales agent (`customers.sales_agent_id`),
and the agent has a location group (`sales_agents.location_group`). The site is the master
one, read off `settings.project_allocation_brw_warehouse_code` (`BRW-BB` -> `BRW`), because
every site runs a `-BB` bin and only Bukit Raja's is the master
(`project_allocation_service.py` module docstring).

Where the chain breaks, the order carries no location and says which link is missing, so the
screen can flag it instead of offering a picker.

Postgres only, via ``blank_session``; fixture builders shared with ``test_project_so_draft``.
