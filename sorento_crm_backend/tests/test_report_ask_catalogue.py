"""Phase 2 RED tests - the report-ask catalogue (lane REPORT-ENGINE, slice 1a).

`documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-report-engine.md` section 10 "Catalogue / datasets".

`app.services.reports.ask.CATALOGUE` maps the spec's words to each definition's columns and
param keys. These tests pin that every word resolves to something that really exists in the
definition it names, so a renamed column cannot leave a dead word behind.

Owner direction 4 Oct 2026: every basis (delivered, ordered, outstanding) reads SALES ORDER lines,
so the catalogue holds three bases and none of them points at the delivery order dataset.
SALES-UNIFIED (#1916, owner ruling 27 Oct: Sales = IV + CS + DN - CN net, by document date) adds a
fourth, `invoiced`, on the billing document lines; the bot asks it first ("Invoiced, delivered,
ordered or outstanding?", owner ruling (b)).

Ambiguity flagged to the captain: PLAN section 10 does not fix the shape of a CATALOGUE entry.
Pinned here (tolerantly): an entry exposes `dimensions` and `filters`, each either a mapping
`spec word -> column / param key` or a plain collection of words that ARE the keys. Entries may
be dicts or objects.
