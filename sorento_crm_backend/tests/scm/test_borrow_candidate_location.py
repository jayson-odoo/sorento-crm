"""Borrow candidate carries the board's own Location row (S4, PLAN-local-supplier-oi-routing.md,
UAC AC-2.20 - AC-2.21).

RED for AC-2.20: `borrow_candidates[]` has no `location` key yet, so the board test below
fails on a `KeyError`. Fixtures copied straight from `tests/test_fulfilment_board.py`
(`_product`, `_warehouse`, `_stock`, `_order`, `_line`, `_service`, `_cell`, `_uid`,
`TODAY`) - same scenario as that file's own
`test_a_board_borrow_candidate_carries_what_it_takes_to_confirm_it`, extended to compare
the candidate's new `location` against the cell's existing `locations` table entry for the
same donor warehouse.

AC-2.21 is `stock_detail`'s existing cross-group behaviour (the endpoint takes an
arbitrary `warehouse_id` with no group restriction already) - written here as the
regression proof the plan calls for; if it turns out already green against current code
that is reported to the captain rather than forced red, per the tester brief.

`test_supply_sheet_line_carries_buy_origin_and_candidate_location` is the third guard, over
`GET /project-sales/sales-orders/{pso_id}/supply` (`ProjectSupplyService.proposal_for`) rather
than the board's `build()` - the coder's own commit message (feat(scm): per-order sheet lines
carry buy_origin and candidate location, S3/S4) named this exact assertion as the one guard
missing before HEAD. The board-side fixtures above build a plain core `SalesOrder`, which this
route cannot address (it takes a `ProjectSalesOrder` id), so this test additionally pulls the
project-sales `api` fixture and helpers from `tests/test_so_supply_confirmation.py` (the file
that already exercises this exact route) plus the supplier/country helpers `tests/scm/
test_supply_origin.py` and `tests/scm/test_summary_order_service.py` already established.

    Not reachable through `borrow_candidates_for` / `_borrow_candidates` on either real
    surface (the board's `_donors_for`, the per-order sheet's own `borrow_candidates`):
    `pools_net` nets EVERY registered pool in the book as one shared pile (its own
    docstring, "not five separate answers to `is there shared stock`"), so
    `_reserve_location_ids` always counts a spare pool as INSIDE Reserve's reach and
    `_borrow_candidates`'s free-stock walk excludes everything `inside` - a pool with
    ANY capacity left is drawn automatically rather than ever being offered as a manual
    Borrow. Measured empirically (a pool-donor line here reserved fully from the pool
    and both real callers returned `borrow_candidates: []`) rather than assumed; flagged
    to the captain as a design question (dead branch vs. a caller that does not exist
    yet), not silently worked around.

    So this reads `donor_location` the way its own docstring says a caller must:
    `_pile_facts`'s span warmed by a real `demand_facts` walk (never a bare
    `ProjectSupplyService` with no request behind it), which is the same precondition
    `borrow_candidates_for` states for itself - a real public sequence, just not the
    ladder's OWN selection of what to offer.
