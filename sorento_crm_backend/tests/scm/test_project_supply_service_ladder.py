"""The source ladder, as the captain last ruled it: v3, 25 August 2026
(`documentation/plans/scm/PLAN-scm-cs-planning-uat.md` section 1b, and 1c for the borrow a
person picks). The file was `..._ladder_v2.py`; the version is out of the name because the
ladder has now been renumbered twice and a name that dates itself goes stale on the next
ruling rather than on the next rewrite.

Service-level (`ProjectSupplyService.proposal_for` / `.confirm`), not HTTP: every scenario
here is about the COMPOSITION and the write path, not the route layer, which
`tests/test_so_supply_confirmation.py` already covers end to end. Warehouse and world
helpers are imported from that suite so the two files cannot come to disagree about what a
Project SO looks like (the same convention `tests/test_supply_partial_confirmation.py`
already follows).

Postgres via `tests/_pg_fixture.py::blank_session`, every test seeding its own chain, per
PRINCIPLES.md and this repo's CI-is-empty lesson.
