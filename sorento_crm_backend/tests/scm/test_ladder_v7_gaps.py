"""Ladder v7.1 - three gaps the fix-pass suite left unwalked (tester pass, S3).

Three cases, three files' worth of behaviour:

- `free_piles_at` (`app/services/scm/supply_assignment.py`) nets a PINNED hold out of the
  pile it offers, even when the hold sits at ANOTHER group's bin - the offer is what is
  left once somebody has already been promised part of it, never the whole pile as it
  stood before anybody was.
- `other_group_left` (`app/services/project_supply_service.py::compose_lines`), the ledger
  R40's offer half needs since the walk itself stopped drawing another group's pile: two
  units of ONE board reaching for the same free pile share it rather than each being
  offered the whole of it.
- `_reissue_without_line` (`app/services/project_supply_service.py`) copies a surviving
  line's hold row for row onto the re-issued revision, and `claim_id` is one of the fields
  copied - a cross-project claim behind a hold does not lapse because a DIFFERENT line of
  the same decision was borrowed away underneath it.

Postgres via `blank_session`, every chain seeded here (CI's database has no data).
