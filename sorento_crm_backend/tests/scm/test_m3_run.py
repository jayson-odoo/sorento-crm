"""SCM M3 - reorder RUN JOB + endpoints (AC-M3.6/3.8/3.10/3.11 + auth).

Drives ``reorder_run_service`` over CONTROLLED synthetic planning rows (a stock row
makes a SKU×warehouse appear in ``scm.net_position_v``; a demand_stat row sets its
rate) inside the rolled-back SAVEPOINT the ``scm_app`` fixture provides. Proves:

  * create_run → run_reorder writes recommendations + sets 'completed' + run-log counts,
  * running→completed and running→failed transitions (failure recorded, worker survives),
  * frozen-input reproducibility - a stored rec reproduces its ROP/qty via the pure engine,
  * a network run writes an allocation breakdown summing to the buy qty,
  * a no-supplier planning SKU that would buy emits an 'exception' rec (never skipped),
  * auth (POST needs scm.reorder.run; GET needs scm.dashboard.view).

``run_reorder`` is called SYNCHRONOUSLY (no live worker required).
