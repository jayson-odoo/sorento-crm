"""The agent column: recognised, carried, stamped, and used to classify when nothing else can.

The captain's real outstanding-SO export carries 20 columns and seven of them resolved to
nothing, so every upload reported them as unrecognised - `Agent` among them. That one is not
cosmetic: SO375073 in his file states no order type and names a debtor with no market
segment, so it was reported unclassifiable while the salesperson who sold it was written in
a column the importer had thrown away.

Four promises are pinned here.

1. Every column in his file resolves (AC-1.1). The six that have nothing to write to are
   deliberately-ignored aliases, which is what makes them stop being reported.
2. The agent code reaches the write path and lands on the order (AC-6.5).
3. It is the THIRD classifier, after the header's own type and the type stated in the file
   and AHEAD of the customer's market segment (captain, 28 Aug 2026: the sales force is split
   by channel, a debtor buys through both) - and only when all four miss is the document
   reported (AC-3.1 / AC-3.2).
4. An agent nobody holds is created and REPORTED, never guessed at and never a reason to
   refuse the file (AC-6.4 / AC-3.3).
