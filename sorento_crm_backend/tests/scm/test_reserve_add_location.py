"""S3 - Reserve add-location (manual BRW), AC-3.2 / AC-3.3 server side.

`ReserveAddDialog.tsx` (Phase 1 FE, lane commit c5426c118) lets a planner add ANY location
with free stock to a line's Reserve section, the site pool included - candidates are the
cell's own `BoardCellLocation[]` filtered to free stock > 0, site pool sorted first (R-A).
`ConfirmReserveComponent` already accepts any warehouse and needed no server change for S3
(PLAN, S3): "Server: no change ... Add one test that a pool warehouse is accepted in
Reserve." What is pinned here is that the EXISTING guard covers a site-pool warehouse
exactly as it covers an own location:

* AC-3.2 - a Reserve at the site pool (not the line's own bin) within what it holds is
  accepted and lands in `so_supply_decisions` naming that warehouse.
* AC-3.3 - a Reserve at the site pool above what is on hand there, once another order
  already holds part of it, is refused by `_check_reserve_against_on_hand` (R14) and names
  the earlier holder - the same guard `tests/test_confirm_reserve_guard.py` pins for an own
  location, retargeted at the pool a planner would add by hand.

Postgres via `tests/_pg_fixture.py::blank_session`, never sqlite. Every FK target is seeded
here or through the shared helper functions in `tests/test_so_supply_confirmation.py`,
never borrowed off an existing row - CI's database is empty.
