"""EMAIL-SO-CHANGES (owner, 12 Oct 2026): the order inquiry email prints a line's Was -> Now
off the change itself, never off the action label.

Real miss, SO400236 (UNIBASE TRADING SDN BHD (PROJECT), FARMFIELD / JB): line SRTWB246,
BRW-BB, qty 1, its one row linked to SPO-2026/05-0037, which had been received in full. The
book moved the line 01/10/2026 -> 02/11/2026. The Order Inquiries Was/Now dialog showed the
move (it reads the fresh row's `previous_qty` / `previous_delivery_date`), the email printed
DELIVERY 02/11/2026 with an empty NEW DATE cell.

Why: `_settle_row_in_place` declines a row whose link is fully received
(`_redirect_row_if_received`), the netting raises a fresh ORDER row that carries the old date
on `previous_delivery_date` ("Replaces 1 used"), the S2 join suppresses the line's DELAY row,
and `refresh_for_decision` records that fresh row as a plain `raised` line with `was=None`. The date move
reached the row and never reached the email.

Same harness as `tests/scm/test_oi_handover_line_total.py`.
