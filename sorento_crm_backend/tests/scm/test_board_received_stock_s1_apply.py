"""S1, apply never fails over a vanished placement (D2, R3 minimum).

`documentation/plans/scm/PLAN-board-received-stock-own-arrival.md` S1, UAC
`board-received-stock-own-arrival-acceptance-criteria.md` AC-S1-1 to AC-S1-3. RED before the
coder's slice lands - written from the CONTRACT (the plan + UAC), with no implementation to
look at.

`planning_change_service._redeal_document` (~:3258) today raises `AppException(409,
code="planning_change_reallocation_no_document")` whenever `available < freed`, whatever
`available` is - including the AC-S1-1 case where it is ZERO (the placement this suggestion
named is no longer on the line at all). The fix splits that one condition in two: `available
<= 0` on a non-cancelled row records "nothing to move" in `released` and returns, `0 <
available < freed` keeps the 409 unchanged (AC-S1-2).

`_apply_one_order` (~:4169+) has no check today for a live row's CORE line having been
closed since the batch was built - AC-S1-3 is new.

Fixtures imported rather than copied, the same convention every other Slice A-D file in this
domain uses:
- `tests.test_planning_changes` (`api` fixture: `(client, world)` with `world.company_id`/
  `.actor`/`.project`/`.product`/`.own_wh`/`.pool_wh`/`.db`; `_confirm`/`_line_payload`/
  `_diff_change`/`_core_so`/`_core_line`/`_project_so`/`_project_line`/`_uid`).
- `tests.scm.test_planning_change_reallocation` (`_drop_line_to_100`: S2's own shape, 234
  wholly Buy, 134 placed on a real PO, 100 raised unlinked, dropped to 100 - composes a
  `reallocate` component for the freed 34 against a REAL `PurchaseOrderLine`; `_links_of`).

Postgres only (`tests/_pg_fixture.py`), every FK seeded here, never a borrowed row.
