"""#1362: the own-arrival credit ledger is per (product, bin), never per bin alone.

Owner (29 Sep 2026): SO382618's SRT357 line, 100 landed for it on SPO-2026/06-0152 at
BRW-BB (on hand 261), was credited 40 "landed for this line" and the rest sent to the BRW
pool, then the confirm guard refused the line on that same 40. Another product's credit at
the same bin had eaten SRT357's own-arrival allowance.

The reproduction: ONE sales order, TWO products, each with its own PO line converted to an
SPO and fully received at the SAME bin, both lines open, walked in the board's own order.
The second product must be credited min(its landed, its need, its own on hand), whatever
the first product's credit drew off the bin. A competing order of each product drives the
group net far below zero, so nothing but the credit can cover either line: any shortfall in
the credit shows up as a Buy.

Postgres only (`tests/_pg_fixture.py`), every FK seeded here, never a borrowed row.
