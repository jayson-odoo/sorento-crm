"""AC-S3-11 (`board-received-stock-own-arrival-acceptance-criteria.md`, added 21 Sep after the
security review): the own-arrival credit (R7) must draw through the SAME capacity ledger every
other rung draws through, so two lines competing for the same physical pile cannot both be
told yes.

Finding pinned here (security reviewer, 21 Sep 2026): in `app/services/project_supply_service.py`

- `own_arrival_credit_for` caps its credit by `fact.group_net_by_location`'s
  RAW `on_hand` (a live physical figure, netted only against what an EARLIER
  line of the SAME product+location already drew as CREDIT in this same walk/call via
  `own_arrival_left`) - never against what an ordinary `RUNG_GROUP_TAKE` draw already took in
  the SAME walk.
- At compose time, the per-unit drawdown loop (inside `compose_lines`) walks every
  `RUNG_GROUP_TAKE` component and charges it against `own_group`/`other_group` EXCEPT an
  own-arrival one, which `continue`s without charging anything. So where one
  unit's ordinary draw (rank tie-break, `_pile_order`) and another unit's own-arrival credit
  compete for the identical bin, the credit is invisible to the ledger the ordinary draw reads
  and writes: both units are told yes.
- At confirm time, `_check_line` adds the credit straight onto its own local
  `capacity[fact.own_code]`, never through `capacity_left` (the `_CapacityLedger`
  every other rung's capacity check draws through, declared once per `confirm()` call and
  threaded through every line of the payload) - the same shape of bypass, one layer
  lower.

Both tests below use `own_arrival_group`/`own_arrival_warehouse` (one ownership group, one
physical bin) so both lines' Reserve is a claim on the exact same on-hand.

CONTRACT CHOICES this file pins:

- AC-S3-11's own text says "order A" / "order B" for the compose (ladder) half - two DIFFERENT
  sales orders sharing one product and one bin, walked together in a single
  `FulfilmentBoardService.build()` call (the board's own unit key names the order,
  per `_unit_key`'s own docstring, so `own_group` truly is a PER-ORDER ledger there and
  the only thing that can still cap the group's book position across two orders sharing a
  ranking tie is the drawdown loop the finding names).
- The two lines are given the SAME `required_date` (a genuine rank tie) and DETERMINISTIC
  `so_number`s, because `_pile_order`'s tie-break is "sales order number, then line number"
  - a tie broken by a RANDOM uuid-suffixed `so_number` (`order_with_lines`'s
  default) makes which line the ordinary rung serves first non-deterministic, and the credit
  bypass is only OBSERVABLE when the credited line loses that tie (the ordinary rung serves
  the OTHER line first, and the credit still hands the loser a second, uncharged copy of the
  same units). `ORDER B`'s number sorts before `ORDER A`'s so the tie-break always serves B
  first ordinarily, and A's own-arrival credit is what is under test.
- The CONFIRM half is measured, not assumed, against three shapes before being written as a
  pin: two SEPARATE orders confirmed in sequence (B first, A second; and the reverse, A first,
  B second) and ONE order with two lines confirmed together in a single `confirm()` call. All
  three are refused as `ReserveOverHand` (`SupplyLinesRefused`, 409, code
  `supply_reserve_over_hand`) - `_check_reserve_against_on_hand` (R14) is an
  INDEPENDENT guard that reads real `Stock` and real confirmed `SOLineAllocation` rows rather
  than either walk-scoped ledger the finding names, and it does not distinguish an
  own-arrival-sourced Reserve request from an ordinary one: every `entry.reserve` item in the
  payload competes against the same "on hand less already held" arithmetic regardless of why
  the caller asked for it. `test_a_reason_does_not_push_a_reserve_past_on_hand`
  (`tests/test_so_supply_confirmation.py`) already pins the same guard for a different bypass
  (a CS override reason) on the identical two-order, sequential-HTTP-confirm shape, so this is
  not a new mechanism, only a new caller of it. This test is therefore written as a GREEN
  REGRESSION GUARD for the confirm path (`AC-S3-11`'s confirm half is satisfied by an existing,
  independent guard, not by fixing `_check_line`'s own ledger) rather than forced red - the
  compose half above is where the finding's damage is real and observable (a planner-facing
  proposal that promises 80 units from an on-hand 40, which is exactly the wrong thing to
  learn from a board that "writes nothing" per `test_fulfilment_board.py`'s own docstring).

Postgres only (`tests/_pg_fixture.py`), every FK seeded here, never a borrowed row.

    (`own_arrival_credit_for` caps the credit by the RAW physical on hand, 100, per this
    file's own docstring above, never by the netted 40). `proposal_for` composes it
    Reserve 40 (own_arrival) + Buy 40 - the credit alone does not clear the whole 80.

    A confirm posting Reserve 80 at that bin must be REFUSED: the bin truly holds only
    40 free once the earlier, competing demand is honoured, and the credit is a second
    STATEMENT about that same physical pile ("this line's own PO put at least 40 of it
    there"), not a second, additional 40 stacked on top of the ordinary reading.

    R14 (`_check_reserve_against_on_hand`) cannot be the guard that catches this: the
    competing line is an open, UNCONFIRMED core SO line with no `SOLineAllocation` of its
    own, so R14's own "silent when nobody else holds here" clause leaves it untouched -
    this shape isolates `_check_line`'s own capacity ledger, the seam this file's
    docstring names, from R14's separate one.

    RED today: `_check_line`'s confirm-time recheck (`project_supply_service.py`) calls
    `capacity_left.state_at_least(fact.product_id, str(source.id), before + credit_qty)`
    - `before` (40, the ordinary reading already seeded into the ledger) PLUS the credit
    (40) - so the bin's stated floor is raised to 80 and Reserve 80 wrongly clears it.
    The right call states the credit as its OWN reading of the bin -
    `state_at_least(..., credit_qty)`, i.e. the pile becomes `max(before, credit_qty)`
    (`state_at_least`'s own semantics), never their sum - so the bin's stated floor stays
    at 40 (the larger of the two readings, 40 and 40) and Reserve 80 is refused.

    Control: `test_confirm_credit_reserve_within_capacity_is_accepted` below (a sibling,
    not this same world - a Reserve here summing to LESS than the line's whole open qty
    would first be refused by the unrelated "components add up" / "whole line either
    wholly stock or wholly Buy" rules, which would test those rules rather than this
    ledger) posts a Reserve fully within what the bin supports and is accepted, so the
    fix is pinned as "the two readings intersect", not "the credit is ignored outright".

def test_confirm_credit_reserve_within_capacity_is_accepted():
    """B1's control, re-aimed (round-4 brief): the earlier version of this control let
    the ordinary reading ALONE satisfy the Reserve, because it set `before` (the
    ordinary reading) equal to `credit_qty` (40 == 40) - a change that dropped the
    credit-through-the-ledger fix ENTIRELY (`own_arrival_left`/`state_at_least` never
    consulted at all) would still pass it, since `before` alone already covers Reserve
    40. That is not a real control on the fix; it only pins that a WORKING credit does
    not over-tighten the ledger.

    Re-aimed so the ordinary reading is genuinely BELOW the Reserve and ONLY the credit
    can lift it high enough to clear: on hand 100 at one bin, a competing, earlier-
    required, UNCONFIRMED core SO line for the WHOLE 100 at that SAME bin, so the
    ordinary date-aware reading `_check_line` seeds `capacity_left` with for THIS
    line's own bin nets to 0 (100 on hand, 100 claimed ahead of it by an earlier date -
    the AC-S3-1 date-aware shape, scaled to consume the whole pile rather than leaving
    40 the ordinary reading could clear alone). This line needs 40, matching its own
    PO's receipt (tier-1 credit 40) exactly - a Reserve of 40 is the WHOLE line, no Buy
    beside it, so the "components add up" and "wholly stock or wholly Buy" rules never
    enter into it, and the confirm exercises `_check_line`'s capacity ledger alone.

    ACCEPTED only because the credit is read: `state_at_least(..., credit_qty=40)`
    raises the bin's stated floor from `before=0` to `max(0, 40) = 40`, which clears
    Reserve 40. Reasoned through `_check_line` directly (not by disabling the block):
    if the own-arrival credit block were skipped, or the ordinary `capacity[own_code]`
    were never raised past `before`, this same Reserve of 40 would read a floor of 0
    and be refused as `ReserveOverHand` / a capacity refusal - so this control is now a
    real one, not one the ordinary reading alone would also pass. GREEN today (S3's own
    fix already reads the credit through `state_at_least`, per this file's B1 test
    above); pinned so a fix that over-tightens the ledger - refusing a legitimate,
    fully credit-backed Reserve - is caught here too.

# S5 (second review round, 21 Sep): the ledger must be charged with what was DRAWN,
# never with the whole theoretical credit computed at candidate-build time.
# ============================================================================


def test_credit_ledger_is_charged_with_what_was_drawn_not_the_whole_credit():
    """S5: `own_arrival_credit_for` is called from `walk()` at candidate-BUILD time
    (`project_supply_service.py`), BEFORE `front_planning_engine.walk_line`'s own
    pool-share sub-step (step 0, drawn ahead of the own-arrival sub-step)
    has told the walk how much of the line's need is already covered from elsewhere.
    `own_arrival_credit_for` computes its credit against `fact.open_qty` - the line's
    WHOLE open quantity - and charges the on-hand ledger (`own_arrival_left[own_code]`)
    for that FULL amount immediately. `walk_line` then draws the own-arrival
    candidate only up to `need` (the line's remainder AFTER the pool share), which can be
    SMALLER than what was already charged - so a sibling line reading the SAME bin's
    on-hand ledger afterwards sees less left than physically true.

    MEASURED SHAPE (`pool_share` fed via `own.pool_warehouse_id`, the same mechanism
    `tests.scm.test_project_supply_service_ladder._group_sites` uses -
    `pool_share_capacity` / `_draw_pool_share`, `front_planning_engine.py`):
    one order, two lines at the SAME own bin, on DIFFERENT required dates so they are two
    separate planning units (`_unit_key` = product + warehouse + date,
    `project_supply_service.py`) and each is walked, and its own-arrival
    credit computed, separately - line 1's PO receipt is not read a second time as line
    2's own tier-1 credit; this file's own S1/S2/B2 tests already pin the tier-1/tier-2
    split, so this test isolates the DIFFERENT bug S5 names by giving line 2 its OWN
    separate PO line rather than relying on line 1's tier-2 spare (see note below on why
    the brief's literal "tier-2 spare from line 1" phrasing does not reproduce against the
    real formula).

    - on hand at the shared own bin: 70.
    - a site pool linked to that bin, on hand 60: default policy (50% dealer retention,
      `DEFAULT_POOL_SHARE_PCT`) spares an allowance of 30 - the whole of it, since the
      pool's OWN floor (60) exceeds the allowance.
    - line 1 needs 40 (own PO line received 40 = tier 1): pool share takes 30 first
      (step 0), leaving a remainder/need of 10 for own-arrival - the credit's ACTUAL draw
      is 10, and line 1 is fully covered (Reserve 30 pool + Reserve 10 own_arrival, Buy 0).
    - line 2 needs 40 too (its OWN separate PO line, also received 40 = tier 1) - the
      pool's project share is already spent by line 1 (one ledger per pool, v8 R-B), so
      line 2 gets nothing from the pool and its need is the whole 40. The group's ordinary
      take at this bin is ALREADY negative before any credit is subtracted (on hand 70,
      the two lines' own combined SO demand 80), so the ordinary rung (question 1) offers
      line 2 nothing either - own-arrival is the only capacity either line has, exactly
      like AC-S3-1's own shape, without needing a third competing order to force it.

    CORRECT (physical): line 1 only ever draws 10 off the bin's on-hand credit-wise (the
    other 30 of its need came from the POOL, a different physical location); 70 - 10 = 60
    remains for line 2's own tier-1 credit, comfortably covering its 40 - Reserve 40
    (own_arrival), Buy 0.

    BEFORE THE FIX: line 1's own-arrival credit was computed as `min(tier1_qty=40,
    open_qty=40) = 40` at candidate-build time and the ON-HAND ledger was charged the
    full 40 - not the 10 `walk_line` actually draws once the pool share is netted out.
    Line 2 then read a falsely-drained ledger (70 - 40 = 30, not the true 70 - 10 = 60)
    and its own credit was capped at `min(40, 30) = 30` - a false, uncharged Buy of 10
    where physically there is none. This test guards the fix: the ledger is charged with
    what `walk_line` actually drew (10) rather than the theoretical credit computed
    before the pool share's own draw was known.

    STATED PLAINLY (the brief's own "if you cannot make the pool share cover part of line
    1 ... report the shape you found" clause): line 1 needing 40 with an own PO line
    received exactly 40 gives it a real tier-2 SPARE of `40 - min(40, qty_ordered 40) = 0`
    by `own_arrival_credit_for`'s own formula (`project_supply_service.py` -
    `spare = sibling_received - min(sibling_received, sibling.qty_ordered)`), which nets
    a sibling's spare against its OWN `qty_ordered` and is entirely blind to whether a
    DIFFERENT rung (pool share) covered part of that sibling's need - so "line 1's unused
    pool-covered 30 becomes line 2's tier-2 spare" is not a shape the real tier-2 formula
    produces; only a line whose PO received MORE than it ordered has real tier-2 spare,
    which is a different, already-covered bug (MB2, `test_tier2_spare_is_spent_once_
    across_siblings`). The reproducible shape for S5's OWN bug (ledger charged the
    theoretical credit, not the actual draw) is the ON-HAND ledger two SEPARATE lines
    share at the SAME bin, pinned above, and giving line 2 its own tier-1 PO rather than a
    tier-2 read off line 1 is what isolates it from the already-covered tier-2 bugs.
