"""R-O: an overdue document counts as supply after a grace period, and says so.

`PLAN-scm-pool-chain-first.md` ruling R-O (issue #586); AC-O.1 to AC-O.4 in
`documentation/plans/scm/scm-pool-chain-first-acceptance-criteria.md`. Written before the
wiring, as PRINCIPLES step 4 requires.

The captain on SO419417, 3 September 2026: "Available for Project" at BRW read 355 off 725
SPO units dated 24 July and 6 August and still unreceived, while the ladder lent 4 units off
the 11 standing on the floor. The display was the honest one - R31 counted a late document
as nothing at all, so the walk ignored goods the whole business is still expecting.

Under R-O a document whose arrival has passed with nothing received counts as supply landing
on `today + overdue_grace_days`, and one later than `overdue_dead_days` counts as nothing,
which is R31 kept for the dead. The ASSUMED date is what the walk plans against, so it is
the component's `arrival_date` and the fulfil date follows it; the sentence names the
lateness, because a promise dated three weeks out that rests on paperwork two months
overdue is a promise the reader has to be able to see through.

SHIPPED policy is 0 / 0 (captain's ruling, 3 Sep 2026) - dead at 0 reproduces R31 exactly,
so production keeps today's behaviour until someone raises the two numbers. This suite
proves the RULE, so every fixture below activates a policy with the RECOMMENDED 14 / 90
explicitly (`GRACE_DAYS` / `DEAD_DAYS`) rather than relying on the shipped default -
`test_overdue_grace_setting.py` covers the 0 / 0 default itself.

The world is `_group_sites` + `_seed_line` - one fixture carrying two rungs (the own bin's
own water and a group sibling's), rather than four worlds for four rungs.

Postgres via `blank_session`, every chain seeded here (CI's database has no data).
