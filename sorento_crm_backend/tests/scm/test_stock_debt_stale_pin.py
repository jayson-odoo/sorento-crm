"""STOCK-DEBT-STALE-PIN: a pin never counts as cover for stock the bin does not hold.

Owner, 14 Oct 2026 (prod, Stock Debt > CB6633-NL > Oct 26): SO424555 line 16 read
"Covered by: On hand BRW-IB", status Pinned, Short 0, while BRW-IB held 0 on hand, 0
reserved. The 'own' allocation (126 held of 336 saved) was CONFIRMED on 8 Oct, two days
after the stock row last moved to 0 - choosing the own location is allowed whatever the
stock - so a pin can be empty from the moment it is made, not only after the stock leaves.

The mechanism: `_supply` drops a bin whose on hand less reserved is <= 0, the allocation
hold then names an event `assign()` cannot find, and the stand-in branch (AC-S2-1b, meant
for bins OUTSIDE the read's span) stood the whole 126 up out of the pin itself. The prod
check (owner, 14 Oct 12:20) found 8 such pins hiding about 406 units of shortfall:
SRTSH1040 SO402757 pinned 150 with 2 free, SRTWCX7604 SO382618 100 with 21 free, CSH2073
SO419595 + SO419598 (8 + 2) at BRW with 0 free, and four more at 0.

The rule now: a pin covers at most the bin's real free stock (on hand less reserved), in the
span or outside it, and the rest is short with no "Covered by" claim.

Postgres only, every row seeded here (the seeding helpers are `test_stock_debt_routes`'s).
