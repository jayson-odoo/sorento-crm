"""STOCK-DEBT-LENDABLE over the wire: which landed pins lend, the cell's wording, view
independence, board parity and the cell wire.

    GET  /api/v1/project-sales/stock-debt/{product_id}/cell?month=

The arithmetic is `test_stock_debt_lendable.py`'s; what is proved here is the READ that
decides lendability (the line's required date against `as_of + lead + 14`, the board's own
borrow-donor window, off the batched lead-time read), that the view's filters never move
stock (R2), that the board path is untouched (R3) and every new wire field by name (R4).
The page stays read-only (owner, 30 Sep 2026: "this is a dashboard view only"); a planner
acts on the fulfilment board, whose Borrow step offers the same far line as a donor.
