"""Tester probes for ladder v7.1 step 3 (S4), written against the coder's own
`test_ladder_v7_supply_borrow.py`, PLAN 3.2 step 3 / 3.3, UAC AC-S4-1..6.

Four scenarios the coder's suite does not already pin, each named for the AC/PLAN clause
it exercises:

* re-confirming the SAME line against a DIFFERENT document cancels the stale placement
  first (PLAN 3.3's "a row raised by an EARLIER revision ... is CANCELLED first, links and
  all"), so the document never reads as claimed twice;
* two lines of ONE confirm sharing ONE document, through the real DB write path
  (`_check_supply_borrow`'s per-confirmation ledger), not just `compose_lines`'s dict
  (already pinned by `test_two_units_of_one_walk_are_not_both_offered_the_same_document`);
* a donor who is not just link-holding but DECIDED (an active `SOSupplyDecision` of its
  own, from its own earlier confirm) - `_supersede_borrowed_donors` has to re-issue that
  revision minus only the borrowed line, and the document has to actually change hands;
* the manual candidate reading `place_supply_borrow` uses is not gated by ladder v4's
  group-deficit rule the way the AUTOMATIC reading is (PLAN 3.3's closing paragraph).

Postgres via `blank_session`, every chain seeded here (CI's database has no data).
