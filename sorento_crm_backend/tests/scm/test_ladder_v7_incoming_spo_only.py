"""Incoming means SPO (31 Aug ruling, R-A).

`documentation/plans/scm/PLAN-scm-planning-feedback-31aug.md` S1,
`scm-planning-feedback-31aug-acceptance-criteria.md` AC-1.1..1.4. Written BEFORE the fix, as
PRINCIPLES step 4 requires.

The captain's own production row named `202607-S0067`, a real `purchase_orders` line, as
what "Borrow incoming" told a planner to take. A PO is still ON ORDER - it has a computed
date, not a delivery date - so step 3 must never offer one, whatever `supply_borrow_reason`
used to say about it. A unit only a PO could cover falls through to the pool step and then
to Buy: not a regression, the point.

The assignment itself (`supply_assignment.assign`, `StockDebtService.assignments_for`) is
untouched - a PO still nets the SPO cut from it, the stock table's "PO qty" column is the
same read, and Stock Debt is unaffected. Only step 3's OFFER changes.

Postgres via `blank_session`, every chain seeded here (CI's database has no data).
