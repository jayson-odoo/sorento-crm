"""RED tests, written before the coder's Phase 2, for Lane F of
`PLAN-order-sheet-oi-reports-22sep.md` (AC-F1..F7 in
`order-sheet-oi-reports-22sep-acceptance-criteria.md`).

STEP 1 MEASURE (captain's brief, 23 Sep 2026), confirmed on this branch before writing
these tests - three sizing paths, all seeded with on hand 702 (single-member: one
location; product-grain: same single location under `policy_type='reorder_level'`; pooled:
two locations, 326 + 376) against ONE confirmed ORDER_BACK row of 493 on a CLOSED, fully
delivered SO line (`qty_ordered = qty_delivered = 493`, `tests.test_reorder_plan_demand_
scope._project_so_delivered_line_with_order_back` - the owner's own measured shape,
CB4702/OI-000749/SO421985), an unscoped All run (`demand_class=None`) with the SO picked:

  (a) SINGLE-MEMBER (`_emit_cell`, default `reorder_point` policy, no forecast demand):
      `_compute_cell`'s `net = 702 - 493 = 209` (project already netted INSIDE `net` via
      `net_position`'s own `committed` term); `sizing_net = net - project_supply_reduction
      = 209`; `rop = 0` (no forecast) so `209 >= 0` does not trigger. The row emits
      `rec_type = 'covered'`, `recommended_qty = 0.0`, `rounded_qty = 493.0` (the DISPLAY-
      only "buy anyway" figure `_covered_rec` always carries, `reason_label = "702
      available in this pool covers 493 committed"`). NO BUY. Confirms the captain's
      reading: `_compute_cell` nets project need against on hand on a non-Project run.

  (b) PRODUCT-GRAIN (`_emit_product`, `policy_type='reorder_level'`, one product-wide
      level of 100, the SAME 702/493 seed): identical shape - `net = 209` (project folded
      into `net` per the one-formula ruling, `_emit_product`'s own "AC-R2" comment), `209
      >= level 100` does not trigger `reorder_level`'s gate, `rec_type = 'covered'`,
      `recommended_qty = 0.0`. NO BUY. Confirms the same reading for the product-grain
      path.

  (c) POOLED (`_emit_pool`, `pool_netting=true`, two members 326 + 376 = 702, the SAME
      493): `_emit_pool` never adopted the one-formula netting - it still computes
      `wh_inputs` off each cell's `retail_net` (project already stripped back OUT) and
      ADDS the raw `pool_project_need` (493, unclamped) on top unconditionally
      (`recommended = retail_recommended + pool_project_need`, `_emit_pool`'s own "AC-E05"
      comment). Measured result: `rec_type = 'buy'`, `rounded_qty = 493.0`, `reason_label
      = "project buy: 493 confirmed unplaced Buy in this pool"`. A BUY EXISTS, in full,
      REGARDLESS of the 702 on hand. This REFUTES the captain's reading for the pooled
      path specifically - `_emit_pool` already satisfies AC-F1/AC-F7's pooled case today.
      Its own test below is a GREEN regression guard, not a red test (same pattern as
      Lane D's `test_ac_d2_service_level_committed_already_scoped_on_all_run_bypassing_
      http`) - it still has to run, because a coder wiring the (a)/(b) fix through a
      shared helper could plausibly break the pool's existing correct behaviour.

Conflicting EXISTING pins (netting-on-All-runs pins this lane's fix will flip; the coder
edits these, citing this ruling - not the tester):

  - `tests/scm/test_reorder_one_formula.py::test_location_row_project_inside_net` (AC-3):
    10,000 on hand vs 200 confirmed project demand on a single-member/`_emit_cell` row,
    pinned `rec_type == 'covered'`, `'project buy' not in reason`, `net_position ==
    9_800.0` - THE SAME shape as measurement (a) above. Lane F flips this to a buy of 200.
  - `tests/scm/test_reorder_one_formula.py::test_no_level_product_row_buys_level_zero_gap`
    (AC-1): B2155-NL-BLUE, on hand 128 + PO 339 against project 493 + retail 170 + level 0,
    pinned `recommended_qty == 196.0` (the netted one-formula gap) and `'project buy' not
    in reason`. Lane F flips this to retail-alone-on-top-of-493-in-full (a different
    number and a "project buy" reason).
  - `tests/scm/test_reorder_per_product.py::test_the_buy_is_the_gap_from_the_net_up_to_
    the_level` (AC-R2): product-grain, on hand 10,860 + PO 860 - project 150 - retail 290
    against level 12,000, pinned `net == 11_280.0`, `recommended_qty == rounded_qty ==
    720.0` (the netted gap, project's 150 folded in). Lane F flips the sizing formula this
    depends on (retail sized on `retail_net`, project's 150 added in full on top), so 720
    is very unlikely to survive unchanged.
  - `tests/scm/test_reorder_per_product.py::test_a_level_sets_bypass_never_fires_when_
    stock_already_covers_the_confirmed_buy` (AC-5): product-grain, 600 on hand vs a 50
    confirmed Buy against a level of 500 (net 550 > level, no trigger), pinned `not
    _buys(rows)`, `rec_type == 'covered'`, `net == 550.0`. THE SAME shape as measurement
    (b) above. Lane F flips this to a buy of 50 in full.
