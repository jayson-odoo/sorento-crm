"""Slice 2 (`PLAN-oi-worklist-split-customer-project.md`, owner 18 Sep 2026): the Raised at
cell's own tooltip - purchasing sees the earlier raise of a carried line, not just the
latest re-confirm's own time.

Seeded DIRECTLY via ORM, not through `ProjectSupplyService.confirm`: this slice's own
read path (a correlated `json_agg` subquery in `order_inquiry_worklist_service.py`) does
not go anywhere near `ProjectSupplyService.confirm` at all, so there is nothing that call
would prove here that constructing the two-rows-one-line shape a re-confirm produces
(`project_order_inquiry_service._write`: the carried row is cancelled, a fresh one raised
under the same `order_inquiry_id`) by hand does not already - the same way
`tests/test_order_inquiry_worklist.py`'s own harness seeds every other shape without
going through the live confirm route either. Tests the worklist query in isolation.
