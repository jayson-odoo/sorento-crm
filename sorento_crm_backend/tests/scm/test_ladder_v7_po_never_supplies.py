"""S4: a PO event may never supply ANY walk offer (captain ruling, 1 Sep 2026).

`documentation/plans/scm/PLAN-scm-planning-feedback-31aug.md` S4,
`scm-planning-feedback-31aug-acceptance-criteria.md` AC-4.1..AC-4.5. Written BEFORE the fix,
as PRINCIPLES step 4 requires.

S1 (`test_ladder_v7_incoming_spo_only.py`) cured step 3 (`supply_borrow`) only. The captain's
own live repro on 1 Sep: a suggestion read "Use incoming 15 from BRW-BB, arriving 6 Sep
2026" with no incoming row anywhere to click - BRW-BB (another project group) had SPO qty 0
and PO qty 978, so the 15 and its 6 Sep arrival came from a PO event flowing through
`ProjectSupplyService._other_group_free_at_own_date` (step 1's OFFER half). The ruling:
**incoming is strictly SPO; a PO event may not supply any walk offer** - own group's own
draw included, since `_drawn_at_own_date` reads the ASSIGNMENT's actual draw for the unit,
and the assignment nets every kind together. A unit only a PO could cover now falls through
to the pool step and then to Buy - not a regression, the point (R-A, 31 Aug; reaffirmed 1
Sep).

Task 2 (option label follows composition) and task 3 (use-incoming names and links its SPO)
are pinned here too: they are the two places the fix is visible on screen, and the captain's
own screenshot was the label disagreeing with the card for the exact case AC-4.1 now refuses
to offer at all.

The assignment itself (`supply_assignment.assign`, `StockDebtService.assignments_for`) is
untouched - PO netting, the stock table's "PO qty" column and Stock Debt are unaffected.
Only the WALK's own candidate lists changed.
