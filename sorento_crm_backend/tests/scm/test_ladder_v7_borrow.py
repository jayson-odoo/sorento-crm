"""Ladder v7.1: use -> borrow on hand -> borrow incoming -> pool -> buy.

`documentation/plans/scm/PLAN-scm-borrow-ladder-v7-stock-debt.md` section 3.2 and the UAC's
AC-S3-1 to AC-S3-14. S4 owns `supply_borrow`; here it is only ever asked and answered.

The rule that shapes every fixture below: **a step covers the WHOLE unit or gives nothing**
(R10/R33). Sources combine INSIDE one step - two bins of the group, two donors of step 2 -
and never across two, because half a promise off the free pile and half off somebody else's
order is two different stories about one delivery. The captain's own reading of AC-S4-2b
("the PO is taken whole ... the 16 on hand stays free") is what pins it.

The second rule that shapes them: under the ONE assignment both this ladder and the Stock
Debt view read (R21), a LATER order's supply is only "held by it" when something PINS it -
a confirmed decision or a placement link. Free stock is drawn at step 1 by whoever is due
first, whatever group it sits in, and raises no debt. So every `order_borrow` fixture here
confirms the donor's decision first: that is not scaffolding, it is the case (R9, R25).

Postgres via `blank_session`, every chain seeded here (CI's database has no data).

    """Review finding 10, reproduced as far as it can be: `_check_group_borrow`'s
    same-agent authorisation gate refusing the ENGINE's own step-2 proposal.

    The gate refuses a donor that shares this line's sales agent and is ranked AHEAD of it
    unless the reason says "authorised by" - and the server's own `order_borrow_reason`
    says no such thing, so a proposal confirmed AS PROPOSED would 422.

    It does not fire, and the reason is structural rather than lucky. The gate is judged on
    `_group_borrow_donors`, which (a) reads THIS line's ownership group only and (b)
    excludes any line another active decision already covers (`_decided_elsewhere`). A
    step-2 donor is by definition a line the assignment reads as `covered` or `pinned` off
    ON HAND - and on hand is pinned only by a confirmed decision (`stock_debt_service
    ._holds`; a placement link pins a DOCUMENT, which is step 3's business). So every
    decided donor is out of the gate's list, and an UNDECIDED covered donor of the asker's
    own group cannot exist while the asker is short: the asker is earlier, so the walk gives
    it the group's pile first.

    This test builds the strongest case the rule allows - same agent, same ownership group,
    ranked ahead, decided - and confirms the proposal verbatim, reason and all.
