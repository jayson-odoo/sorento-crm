"""AC-CF-1..16 (`PLAN-oi-confirm-per-so.md`,
`oi-confirm-per-so-acceptance-criteria.md`): red tests written BEFORE the coder, against
the contract only - no implementation for this slice exists yet.

S1 of the plan REVERSES G4 (`PLAN-scm-reorder-oi-feedback-1sep.md`): a row raised from
the fulfilment board is born `awaiting` again, not `acknowledged`
(`_handshake_for_raise`, `app/services/project_order_inquiry_service.py`), and
purchasing's own Confirm press is what takes it on - the very thing G4 retired. Most of
the assertions below therefore state the POST-S1 world and fail TODAY for that single
reason: the raise still stamps `ACK_ACKNOWLEDGED`. `tests/test_order_inquiry_handshake.py`
and `tests/test_order_inquiry_handshake_edges.py` pin the PRE-S1 (G4) behaviour this lane
retires and are left untouched here - they are the coder's to update, not the tester's.

Reuses `tests/test_order_inquiry_handshake.py`'s harness wholesale (`world` / `api`
fixtures - one CS user, one purchasing user, one project, one product, one warehouse,
company-scoped and rolled back; `_raise_one_row`, `_as_purchasing`, `_settle`,
`_project_committed`, `_open_po_line`, `_links_of`) rather than rebuilding it: every row
this file touches is seeded fresh, behind that harness's own `zzt-planchg` / `ZZT-`
markers, inside ONE outer transaction rolled back at teardown - nothing here depends on
a row already in the shared local database.

Runs on the REAL database (rolled back), for the same reason the harness does:
`scm.committed_v`, the `ack_state` column and its index all live in the migrated schema,
which a blank scratch schema does not carry.

    rather than, say, 0 or the whole matched count. Isolated from

    `reject` press cascades a whole-order re-confirm that cancels-and-carries every
