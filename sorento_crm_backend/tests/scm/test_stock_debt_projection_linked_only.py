"""STOCK-DEBT-PROJECTION, rule D (owner, 12 Oct 2026, 22:20).

In the project projection, pool supply (BRW and every other pool) counts for a project
ONLY when it is linked to that project line: the S/O ref on the PO/SPO line, an OI
placement (a confirmed planning decision no longer counts: STOCKDEBT-NO-PLAN-REACH, owner
28 Oct 2026, a decided line reads as undecided). Incoming or landed alike: a linked SPO that
lands becomes an on-hand hold and keeps covering, as Covered by does today. Unlinked pool
on hand and unlinked incoming POs/SPOs never count. The projection agrees with Covered by
line for line.

Crew answer (b), same day, following the owner's HQ decision (HQ-PROJECT-RESERVE, #1597): a
PROJECT RESERVE (a warehouse some location names as its pool, with `segment = project`) is
the one exception. Its UNLINKED incoming documents (PO on its Delivery date, SPO on its ETA)
are carried, display only, to the earliest project shortfall, labelled "<code> reserve PO".
Reserve on hand is #1597's walk, not this layer.

The shape is SRTWT2215's BRW SPO 333: a BRW-BB line owes 500 in two months, and SPO 333
at BRW arrives next month. Received or not, linked or not, the projection must read the
same before and after the goods are received (no jump on receipt).
