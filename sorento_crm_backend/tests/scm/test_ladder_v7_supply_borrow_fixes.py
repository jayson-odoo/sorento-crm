"""S4 fix pass: the ten defects `/code-review` confirmed on ladder v7.1 step 3, one test each.

`documentation/plans/scm/PLAN-scm-borrow-ladder-v7-stock-debt.md` 3.2 step 3 + 3.3, UAC S4.
Written BEFORE the fixes, as PRINCIPLES step 4 requires, and each one names the defect it
pins rather than the code that repairs it.

The thread running through most of them is the same: a step-3 component is a claim on a
DOCUMENT, and a document is claimed in three different ledgers at once - the walk's own
(`supply_left`), the placement links (`order_inquiry_links`) and the instruction rows
purchasing reads. A fix that moves one and not the others leaves the quantity either
promised twice or promised to nobody, and both look like a plain arithmetic bug on screen.
