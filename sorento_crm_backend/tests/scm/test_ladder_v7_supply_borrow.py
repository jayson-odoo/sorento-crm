"""Ladder v7.1 step 3: BORROW THE DOCUMENT a later order is waiting on (S4).

`documentation/plans/scm/PLAN-scm-borrow-ladder-v7-stock-debt.md` section 3.2 step 3 and
3.3, UAC AC-S4-1 to AC-S4-4. Written before the code, as PRINCIPLES step 4 requires.

Four rules shape every fixture below.

**ONE DOCUMENT, WHOLE UNIT** (R33). An SPO of 5 beside a PO of 7 does not cover a unit of
12: the step gives nothing and the walk moves on. Sources combine inside step 2 (two on-hand
donors are one timing) and never here, because two documents landing on two dates are two
different promises about one delivery.

**SPO BEFORE PO, AND A PO ONLY WHEN NO SINGLE SPO COVERS** (R27, R30, R35). An SPO is
ARRIVING - it has been cut from a purchase order and put on a shipment; a PO is still ON
ORDER. Nearest arrival first inside each family.

**ELIGIBLE MEANS IT BEATS BUYING** (R32). A document is taken when it arrives by the asker's
date OR before a fresh purchase would land (`as_of + lead`). The captain, on AC-S4-2b's row:
"if buy, it is going to arrive even later". Such a line is `late`, and it is earlier than
every alternative the ladder has left.

**A DOCUMENT REACHES STEP 3 IN EXACTLY TWO WAYS**, and every fixture below is one of them.
Under the ONE assignment the board and the Stock Debt view share (R21), step 1 already
answers with a document that is FREE BY THE ASKER'S OWN DATE - its own group's water
(`_drawn_at_own_date`) or another project group's free pile at that date (`free_piles_at`,
R40). So step 3 is what is left:

* the document lands AFTER the asker's date, so no free pile holds it when the asker asks,
  and it is taken only because it still beats buying (R32); or
* the document is PINNED to a later order - a confirmed decision or a placement link - so it
  is free to nobody, whatever its date. That is the same discovery step 2's own suite
  records: "a LATER order's supply is only held by it when something PINS it", and it is not
  scaffolding, it is the case.
