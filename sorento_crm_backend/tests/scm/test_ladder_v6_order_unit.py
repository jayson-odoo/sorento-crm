"""Ladder v6: one order's lines for one item, one location and one delivery date are ONE
planning unit (`documentation/plans/scm/PLAN-scm-order-unit-ladder-v6.md`).

The captain, reading SO381895 on the board: lines 31 and 32, same item, same location, same
delivery date, 10 and 20. The board proposed Borrow 10 for one and Buy 20 for the other.
"This is 1 order as a whole, so we should look at the order as a whole instead of line by
line ... for the same delivery date." Each line obeyed the whole-LINE rule; the order did
not.

What is pinned here (the UAC's own numbering):

* **AC-U1** two lines of one order, one item, one location, one date: covered whole from
  stock or bought whole, never "one borrows and the other buys";
* **AC-U2** the unit draws the shared pool ONCE and the draw is split across its lines;
* **AC-U3** a different delivery date is a different unit, and v5's answer stands for it;
* **AC-U4** a different fulfilment location is a different unit;
* **AC-U5** a component that straddles two lines keeps its kind, source, rung and reason on
  both halves, and the halves sum to it;
* **AC-U6** the sheet, the freeze and the board compose one order the same way;
* **AC-U8** `unit_qty` and `unit_line_count` reach the wire on both surfaces
  (`response_model` drops what a schema does not declare);
* **AC-U9** the cross-group donor is a running ledger across the walk: the first unit
  borrows it and the later units buy whole, which is what the confirmation was refusing.

AC-U7 (every ladder v4 / v5 test passes unchanged) is the existing suites, not a test here.
