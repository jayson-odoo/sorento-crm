"""BORROW-OWN-LOC (`documentation/plans/scm/PLAN-board-borrow-own-location-13oct.md`).

Owner, 13 Oct 2026: the line's OWN location always appears under Borrow, whatever holds the
stock there, whatever the "Borrow from another order" switch says. The typed quantity is not
capped: Confirm passes. What is actually HELD at the own location never exceeds what is free
there after this line's own Reserve; the rest is confirmed as decided and recorded short with
the OI-CLOSED-LINE sentence, so the same units are never counted twice.

Postgres via `blank_session`; every chain seeded here. Board fixtures from
`tests/test_fulfilment_board.py`, confirm fixtures from the ladder suite, with the
justification that earned them there.
