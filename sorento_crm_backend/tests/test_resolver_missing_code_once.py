"""A missing product code is looked up once per resolve request, not once per pass.

CHAT-SLOW-MISS (4 Oct 2026): "srtwc286 , srtwc6022  srt5764  stock" spent 25-34s in
the `routed` stage, 19s of it between two lookups of the one code that does not exist.
`resolve_gate` asks the resolver with `fallback_to_all_types=True`, so an unresolved
token runs the whole pipeline twice: the primary pass under the parser's `product` hint,
then the all-types fallback (`references._resolve_input`). The fallback re-ran every
probe the primary pass had already run for that token, embedded the same string a second
time (an OpenAI round trip each), and its cross-type expansion then ran every Tier-1 and
Tier-2 probe a THIRD time over a token they had just found nothing for.

Measured on a seeded copy (25k products, 150k orders, embedding stubbed at 0.5s): one
resolve took 4.8s, 131 statements, 2 embeddings; see the PR for the after numbers.
