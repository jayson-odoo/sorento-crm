"""GET-route permission gates on the user-management surface.

Context: `documentation/plans/security/PLAN-user-management-read-gates.md` +
`documentation/plans/security/user-management-read-gates-acceptance-criteria.md`.
Thirteen GETs across `teams.py` / `access_agents.py` / `contact_access_types.py`
were `Depends(get_current_user)` only - any authenticated session, regardless of
role, could read the contact directory, staff rosters, the agent-to-contact
access matrix and per-field ACL rows. They now require
`user_management.teams.view` or `user_management.access_agents.view` via
`Depends(require_permission(...))`.

A follow-up change resolved the plan's deferred Q1, Q2 and Q3 the same way,
taking the gated total to 24: the eight `contacts` GETs now require the newly
registered `user_management.contacts.view`, the two cross-module reference
catalogs (`contact-access-types/`, `market-segments/`) require the equally new,
deliberately low-privilege `user_management.reference_data.view`, and the full
settings blob requires `user_management.settings.view`. The two new slugs are
registered AND granted by migration `359_um_contacts_reference_perms` - a slug
with no grant path would 403 the feature it was meant to protect. That grant is
exercised against the migration itself in
tests/test_migration_359_um_contacts_reference_perms.py.

A third pass added the two `system_logs` reads (`GET /system-logs/` and
`GET /system-logs/users/{user_id}`) on the already-registered
`user_management.logs.view`, taking the total to 26. An independent review found
them - the structural sweep below could not, because its scope was a hardcoded
set of seven module names and `system_logs.py` is an eighth. That scope is now
the whole `app.api.v1.user_management` package, matched on the module path
prefix, so the next file to arrive is in scope with nothing to remember.

Structure:

* Work item 3 (UAC1.1-1.3, 2.1-2.2, 3.1-3.2, 6a.2, 6c.2) - one 403 + one 200 per
  gated route, table-driven. 25 of the 26 gated routes live in that table; the
  26th, `GET /settings/`, needs a seeded settings singleton and is covered
  alongside its `/app-config` sibling in tests/test_settings_app_config_gate.py.
* UAC2.3 - the field-access 403 fires before any field-access row is read.
* Work item 4 (UAC4.1-4.3) - structural coverage: every GET in the
  user-management package carries a permission dependency or sits in a commented
  exception allowlist, so a route added tomorrow without a gate fails this test.
* Work item 5 (UAC3.3, 5.1, 5.2) - the documented exceptions stay exactly as
  documented: the quick-access read is self-scoped, and the contacts/companies
  read is gated in the handler body rather than by dependency. The active-only
  contact-access-types catalog was a third exception until Q3 was decided; its
  test now pins the reference-data gate that replaced it, including the negative
  that matters most (UAC6c.4): holding `access_agents.view` does NOT open the
  reference catalogs, so the low-privilege slug cannot be quietly collapsed back
  into the admin one.

tests/test_user_respond_users_permission.py (PR #168).
