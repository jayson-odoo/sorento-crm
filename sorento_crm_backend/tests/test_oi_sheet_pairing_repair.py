"""The order inquiry sheet pairs on AutoCount's OWN line reference.

Contract: `documentation/plans/scm/scm-oi-sheet-pairing-repair-acceptance-criteria.md`,
AC-R-1 to AC-R-16, with `PLAN-scm-oi-sheet-pairing-repair.md` sections 2.1 to 2.4 for the
promised behaviour. One test per criterion, named for it.

TEST-FIRST, written before the importer was repaired. The red state is therefore the
SHIPPED behaviour of #875 - no link at all where AutoCount states one, the wrong sales
order line under a citation, two rows raised where the customer restated one - or a
`ModuleNotFoundError` for a rollback script that does not exist yet. Never an import typo
and never a fixture bug.

What changes, in the operator's words (owner rulings R1 to R3, 14 Sep 2026):

* **R1** the pairing is `purchase_order_lines.from_so_line_ref = sales_order_lines.source_ref`
  (and the `spo_allocations` twin, and `from_po_number` onwards to the shipping order).
  Claims become the FALLBACK, and `po_history` - the poisoned August Excel - pairs nothing.
* **R2** when several lines of the order fit, the line the CITED document names wins, and a
  cancelled ghost line loses to any real line that fits.
* **R3** a row that restates another on SO + item + qty + delivery date + location is a
  restatement whatever its remark says, and it lends its citation to the row it restates.

Fixture vocabulary, as the UAC spells it: a "ref" is `sales_order_lines.source_ref`
(`AED_SORENTO:41576559:41604391`); a PO line or SPO allocation "names" a line when its
`from_so_line_ref` equals that ref.

Postgres only (`tests/_pg_fixture.py`, `blank_session` through the parent file's `world()`).
Every chain is seeded here - company, uom, category, product, warehouse, supplier, sales
order + lines, purchase orders + lines, allocations, claims - because CI's database is
empty and nothing may be read off an existing row. The seed helpers are IMPORTED from
`tests/test_project_order_inquiry_import_migration.py` rather than copied, so the two files
cannot drift about what a seeded world is.

    issue #915). An ORDER BACK row's `delivery_date` is None - the words in the date cell
    are never a date - and `_rank_for`'s date term reads `line.required_date == wanted`
    with no guard against BOTH sides being None. An undated line then ties that term with
    the row for the wrong reason (the sheet stated no date at all, not "the same date as
    this undated line") and wins ahead of a line the book actually bought for and shipped
    in full.

    Two lines of one item on one order: L1 undated and named by nothing, L2 dated and
    named by a purchase order line that a shipping order shipped in full. One ORDER BACK
    row for the item. The row must land on L2, take the shipment, and report L2's own
    date - not None.
