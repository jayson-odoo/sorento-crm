"""The order inquiry handshake: CS raises, purchasing acknowledges (`PLAN-scm-oi-handshake.md`).

Links are purchasing's word. Nothing is linked when a row is raised; the cascade runs at
ACKNOWLEDGE, at Link now, and at a purchase-order confirm, and every one of those three is
restricted to rows purchasing has taken on. What is pinned here, one test each:

* AC-H1/AC-H11 a board confirm raises `awaiting` rows and links NOTHING, even with an open
  purchase-order line sitting there waiting for the product;
* AC-H2 Acknowledge takes a batch on, stamps who and when, and runs the cascade for exactly
  those rows;
* AC-H3 a CS user (no `projects.order_inquiries.acknowledge`) is refused 403 by every
  one of the three write routes;
* AC-H4 the `ack` filter is a closed set, and the facet counts all four states with its own
  filter dropped;
* AC-H5 a reject needs a reason, and 422 says so;
* AC-H6 a rejected row leaves `scm.committed_v` and the plan's own committed SELECT, and the
  line goes back to the board undecided carrying the reason;
* AC-H7/AC-H8/AC-H9 an amend before acknowledgement is silent, one after it reads `changed`
  with the previous value and its links kept, and re-acknowledging returns it;
* AC-H10 the plan counts acknowledged and changed rows only, and awaiting rows are a count;
* AC-H13 Link now is scoped to the products named;
* AC-H14 every new column is on the wire from the list, the summary and the export.

Runs on the REAL database (rolled back), like `test_planning_change_apply_on_board`:
`scm.committed_v` is a view a migration installs and the blank scratch schema has none.
Every row is seeded here behind the marker - CI's database has no data.
