"""Every ACTIVE prompt key has a row after the migrations run (owner report, 5 Sep 2026).

The Prompts screen for `chatbot_clarifier` was empty: `ai_prompt_versions` held two rows
for `chatbot_semantic_parser` and none for the clarifier, so the runtime silently used
`ai_prompt_registry._chatbot_clarifier_fallback` and the owner had nothing to edit.

The cause is an ORDERING one, and it is the reason this test runs the migration rather
than the seeder. `seed_prompt_registry` loops over `PROMPT_KEYS`, so it always covers
whatever is registered WHEN IT RUNS - asserting that directly would be a tautology. What
can actually go wrong is a slice registering a new key AFTER the last migration that
calls the seeder: every database already at that revision then has a key with no row, and
nothing fails. That is exactly what the local dev database showed, because its seed was
run by hand at 475, before S4 registered `chatbot_clarifier` and before S3 registered the
eleven `chatbot_reply_*` keys.

So the assertion is: run the LAST migration in this lane that seeds, on a blank schema,
and every active key must come out with a version and a `production` label. A future
slice that adds a key without a seeding migration fails here.

Migration is imported and executed for real (the `_run_migration_310` idiom in
`tests/test_complaint_settled_on_site.py`), not re-stated, so the test cannot drift from
the migration it grades. Postgres blank schema, per PRINCIPLES.
