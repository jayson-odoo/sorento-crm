"""Phase 2 RED tests - issue #1262 (Samantha case), group B, slice 4, finding F3.

Turns T6 to T9 of the diagnosed conversation. Source:
`documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-chatbot-samantha-slices-26sep.md` slice 4 and
`chatbot-samantha-slices-26sep-acceptance-criteria.md` AC-S4-1, AC-S4-2, AC-S4-3.

The bug (`turn/decide.py::_subject_reading`, read from the OUTSTANDING_KINDS arm at
`decide()`): an open outstanding offer (`pending.kind` in `OUTSTANDING_KINDS`,
`pending.payload["domain"]` the domain it was asked for) REFINES on any turn that names
an entity and no domain word of its own, with no comparison at all between the verdict's
own `domain_hint` and the offer's domain. A photo read as "X5: M210-GM" (T7) carries no
domain word (`domain_in_message: false`) but the parser DOES read it as an incoming
question (`domain_hint: "incoming"`) - the REFINE arm forces it back onto the open
order-domain offer instead (`turn/apply.py::_answer_outstanding`,
`focus.domains = [asked_for]`), and three photos in a row (T7, T8, T9) each re-arm the
same question and replay the same poisoned filters at `crm_outstanding_report`.

T6 ("got eta") is the other half: `domain_in_message: true`, `domain_hint: "incoming"`,
no entities - the message names a domain of its own but decide() files it as CARRY
`nothing_answered` (no entity, so none of the NEW_ASK rows fire) and
`_answer_pending`'s tail (`answer_pending_not_an_answer`) keeps the pending open exactly
as it was, unmodified. Owner ruling (hand pass 3, T6 half - PLAN "Owner rulings"): a turn
naming another domain closes the outstanding offer.

Both are read PURELY off the verdict's own fields (`domain_in_message`, `domain_hint`)
against the pending's own stored domain (`pending.payload["domain"]`) - never a text
match, never a hard-coded phrase (owner ruling 1 is about quantity, not this finding, but
the same "read the parser's own output" discipline applies).

Seam chosen (tester's own call, `documentation/plans/chatbot` convention, e.g.
`test_outstanding_lane.py`'s own "Tester's own choices" section): `decide()` directly for
the pure reading (AC-S4-1's first half), `apply()` for the state/domain effect every AC
needs, and `apply()` -> `turn_runtime.lane_parse_output(..., domain=spec.domain)` ->
`lanes.business.run_fetch` for AC-S4-1's tool-pick half - the same three-seam chain
`turn_runtime.py::_narrow_and_plan`'s own `runner()` uses per fetch spec in production
(`lane_out = lane_parse_output(verdict, focus=focus, domain=domain, policy=policy)`,
then `run_fetch` reads `domain = parse_output.get("domain_hint")` to pick the tool).
