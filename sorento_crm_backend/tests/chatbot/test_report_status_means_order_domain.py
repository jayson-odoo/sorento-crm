"""Port of main's `test_output_exchange_unit.py::TestReportOrderStatusAlwaysReaches
TheReportDespiteAWrongDomainHint` onto the new seam (coder 25's own pins table, 20 Sep
2026: "main's `TestReportOrderStatusAlwaysRoutesToOrderDomain` (4 tests) is the one
thing worth porting: the same rule now lives in `turn_runtime._report_status_means_
order_domain`, plus a FIFTH case the port needed - `intent_hint == "low_stock_report"`
is left alone").

Main's own finding 3(b) (owner live testing, 19 Sep 2026, PLAN-chatbot-sales-report.md):
the measured emission for "Srt5674 August total sale quantity" parsed `order_status:
"sales_report"` alongside `domain_hint: "master_products"` - the parser knew the ask was
a report and still named the wrong domain, and `lanes/business/__init__.py`'s tool-pick
override for `sales_report` (like the outstanding one beside it) only fires when
`domain == "order"`, so the turn fell through to the product-master listing instead of
the report. The fix re-homed here reads ONLY the parser's own structured `order_status`/
`status` fields, never the message text.

Unit-level, no DB, no turn engine, no mocks beyond a plain dict - `_report_status_means_
order_domain(out: dict) -> None` mutates its argument in place and is the one seam every
verdict passes through (`turn_runtime.with_routing_agent_default`), so this is a direct,
honest test of the real function, not a re-implementation of it.
