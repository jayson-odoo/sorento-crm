"""Crew browser pass on 9fba50f0 (TESTER-LOCAL, PR #1415): "Srtswt3001 / Srtswt3001-gm
stock" answered SRTSWT3001-GM only. SRTSWT3001 exists with 7 stock rows on the copy.

`resolve_entity_body` defaulted `match_mode` to "and" (resolve_gate.py), and the resolve
route returns a non-empty AND result untouched (references.py, `_resolve`'s AND arm). The
prefix probe for `srtswt3001` matches BOTH products and `srtswt3001gm` matches only the
-GM one, so the intersection is SRTSWT3001-GM alone: SRTSWT3001 vanished with no
unresolved token and no miss. Two product codes name two products; a product cannot be
both, so AND across product tokens only ever folds one code onto another's variant.
