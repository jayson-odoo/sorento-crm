"""S7 - thin spine + CRM per-contact ordering + optional worker offload (RED, tester-first).

Covers AC-701, AC-703, AC-704, AC-709, AC-710, AC-713, H12; a best-effort static check for
H6. AC-702, AC-705 and AC-712 already have tests elsewhere on this lane
(`test_chat_turn_endpoint.py::TestDryRunEndpointZeroWrites`, `test_d15_duplicate_race.py`) and
are deliberately NOT duplicated here. AC-706 to AC-708, AC-711, AC-714 are n8n/E2E and out of
scope for pytest.

**Written BEFORE `app/services/chatbot/dispatch.py` exists.** As of this commit the lane head
(4a5920f66) has no `dispatch` module - the plan's own S7 section names it
(`documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-chatbot-turn-engine.md` line 604: "`dispatch.py`: redis
ticket FIFO per contact inside the request") but nothing has built it yet. A `dispatch.py`
carrying `reinject_envelope` (AC-705) exists on the separate, unmerged
`feat/chatbot-turn-engine-s2b` worktree - that is a different function for a different AC and
is untouched here; do not assume it lands as part of this file going green.

**The contract this file locks in for the coder** (the plan's prose, made concrete):

* Redis keys, per contact: `chatbot:seq:{contact}` (INCR'd ticket counter, 1h TTL),
  `chatbot:done:{contact}` (last-completed ticket, absent == 0), `chatbot:running:{contact}`
  (present while a ticket is actively being worked; absent otherwise - deleted, not expired,
  so its ABSENCE is the death signal `wait_for_turn` watches for).
* `dispatch.contact_ticket(redis, contact) -> int` - `INCR chatbot:seq:{contact}`, then
  `EXPIRE` 3600s, returns the new ticket.
* `dispatch.mark_running(redis, contact, ticket) -> None` - sets `chatbot:running:{contact}`.
* `dispatch.mark_done(redis, contact, ticket) -> None` - sets `chatbot:done:{contact} = ticket`
  and clears `chatbot:running:{contact}`. Called in the engine's `finally`, so a mid-turn
  exception still releases the next waiter (AC-704).
* `dispatch.wait_for_turn(redis, contact, ticket, *, timeout_s) -> None` - polls every
  `dispatch.POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (200 ms) until `chatbot:done:{contact} >= ticket - 1`.
  While waiting, if `chatbot:running:{contact}` has been ABSENT for more than
  `dispatch.STALL_GRACE_SECONDS` (2 s) - tracked by the poller itself, not stored in redis -
  it self-heals: sets `done = ticket - 1` and returns, rather than waiting out the predecessor
  that will never finish. Exceeding `timeout_s` with no repair raises `dispatch.QueueWait`.
  Both constants are module-level so a test can shrink them.
* `engine.run_turn`, at the top of the wrapped stage-runner (`stage[0]` already exists for
  exactly this reason - the generic `except Exception` in `run_turn` records whatever
  `stage[0]` says), sets `stage[0] = "queued"` and - only when
  `system_settings.chatbot_ordering_enabled` is `True` (default `False` until S7 promotes) - calls
  `dispatch.contact_ticket` then `dispatch.wait_for_turn(timeout_s=settings.
  chatbot_queue_wait_seconds)`. A `QueueWait` propagates out of the ordering call exactly like
  any other exception the existing handler already catches - `stage[0]` is `"queued"`, so the
  turn closes `failed`, `stage="queued"`, and the caller still gets `GENERIC_ERROR_REPLY` as a
  `send_message` action (AC-710's second half; the shape is `engine._failed_result`, already
  covered for other stages by `test_engine_failure_paths.py`). On success it calls
  `dispatch.mark_running`, sets `stage[0] = "received"`, and wraps the rest of the turn in a
  `finally: dispatch.mark_done(...)` so a later exception still releases the ticket (AC-704).
  With the flag off (default), `dispatch` is never imported or called (AC-701).
* Worker offload: `settings.chatbot_turn_on_worker` (default `False`). When `True`,
  `run_turn` enqueues via `app.services.queue_service.enqueue_job(..., queue_name="chat")`
  (imported into `engine.py` at module level, same shape as `app/api/v1/external/media.py`'s
  `enqueue_job` import) instead of running in-process, and waits up to `settings.
  chatbot_turn_wait_seconds` (default 60) for the result - this file asserts only the
  observable contract (`queue_name="chat"`, the job's result becomes the returned
  `TurnResult`), not a specific polling primitive, so the coder is free to reuse
  `app.services.queue_service.get_job_status` or poll `rq.job.Job` directly.
* `chat` joins `worker.QUEUES` (a `fast` role - it is request-latency-bound the same way
  `respond_io` and `media` are) and therefore `worker.DEFAULT_QUEUES`; extended (not
  duplicated) in `tests/test_worker_queue_defaults.py`.

Nothing here reaches an LLM, n8n or respond.io. Concurrency tests use real, committed
Postgres via `SessionLocal` and a real local Redis (`settings.redis_url` - confirmed reachable
in this environment via `redis-cli ping`), the same reasoning `test_d15_duplicate_race.py`
gives for why a single-connection rollback-scoped fixture cannot show two real threads racing.
Marker-prefixed (`ZZT-`) and cleaned up by hand in `finally`.
