"""Shared builders for the S2 `app/services/chatbot/turn/` red tests (AC-1520 to
AC-1528, PLAN-chatbot-turn-rearch.md).

Not itself a test file (no `test_` prefix - pytest never collects it).

`verdict(**overrides)` is a PLAIN DICT, not a pydantic class (captain ruling, 16 Sep
2026, item 6: Verdict is a plain dict). Every key defaults to the parser schema's own
"said nothing" value.

`PENDING_KINDS` (captain ruling, item 1, 16 Sep 2026): the LANE's eight names, not
main's - `product_pick`, `customer_pick`, `tier_pick`, `team_pick`, `company_pick`,
`member_offer`, `outstanding_scope`, `outstanding_detail`, plus `kind_pick` as the ninth
(reconciliation-only) kind, not counted in the eight. `ROSTER_KINDS` (stay alive after
their own pick, with `answered_positions`) = `product_pick`, `customer_pick`, `tier_pick`
(+ `kind_pick`, outside the eight); the other five clear when answered.

SUPERSEDED for `tier_pick` (hand pass 9, D3, owner ruling 20 Sep 2026 - the same ruling
`app/services/chatbot/turn/pending.py::ROSTER_KINDS` already carries): the 16 Sep ruling
above clocked `tier_pick` as an OFFER kind. Main's fresh-typed picker gate
(`tail/compile_state.py`) draws no kind-based distinction at all - a `require_specific`
roster stays answerable across as many picks as the customer makes, and the tier ask is
the identical shape (a numbered list, one axis), so treating it as a one-off offer that
clears on its own pick was the gap (live turn 25dcef1d-decc-407b-a6eb-08d8112ee814).
`ROSTER_KINDS` below now matches the real code.
