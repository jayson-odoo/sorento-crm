"""Hand pass 12 RED tests, SECOND batch (tester 51, hand pass 12, continuing tester
50's `test_rearch_r12_handpass12.py` - imported from rather than copy-pasted, per the
harness convention that file's own module docstring already states). No implementation
for any of this exists yet.

Two groups:

GROUP C - rerun on a RECORD KEY miss (owner ruling, 21 Sep 2026). `app/services/chatbot/
turn/decide.py:427-478`'s own REFINE table stays exactly as it is: a message with
entities and no domain word combines the carried subject with what it types
(`domain_in_message: false` + entities -> REFINE, `refines_standing_subject`). What is
NEW is the ANSWERING side: when that combined call MISSES and the entity typed in THIS
message is the domain's own RECORD KEY (incoming: `inbound_shipment` - a container/
shipment number; order: an order number, hints `order`/`customer_order`; PO: a PO
number), the engine reruns ONCE with ONLY the current message's own entities (every
carried filter dropped), and the reply says what was dropped. A typed FILTER (customer,
product, date, brand) never triggers a rerun - C3/C4/C6 are green guards pinning that.

Turns replayed: 5fbc9ee3 ("INCOMING SRTJC1303-R", carries product SRTJC1303-R onto
focus in domain incoming) then 0064e1b5 ("TCNU3167091" - a container/shipment number,
hint `inbound_shipment`, `continuation: true`) - the live trace's own recorded verdict
and tool-call args (`.claude/handpass/hp12-turns-21sep.json`) show the COMBINED call
carrying both `product_ids` AND `shipment_ids` and MISSING ("But no incoming matched
these. Would you like me to escalate to purchasing team?"); turn 834d9bdc ("for all
products") is the live shipment-only HIT this pass's C1 borrows the envelope shape of
(a real container with several product rows). Turn 229e3344 ("only TCNU3167091") is
C7(i)'s own base verdict, entity_op forced from its OWN recorded "replace_combine" to
"replace" for that one test.

GROUP B2CD - customer service escalation always shows the member picker (owner ruling,
relayed after tester 50's B2(a), which retired the did-you-mean-miss reply's own second
numbered list). See `TestGroupB2CDCustomerServiceEscalationAlwaysShowsTheMemberPicker`'s
own docstring for the measured "no roster-fetch call exists yet" finding and the outcome-
only assertion discipline that finding calls for.

Harness: `test_rearch_r12_handpass12.py`'s own helpers, imported directly - `_focus`,
`_seed_state`, `_state_of`, `_said`, `_order_row`, `_order_envelope`, `_unknown_envelope`,
the tool name constants, and `TestGroupBDidYouMeanPickByTypedLabelsReachesTheTool` (its
`_seed_pending` is reused for B2(a)'s own did-you-mean-plus-CS-offer starting state,
rather than a second copy of that fixture). `_mcp_double` / `_seed_contact_and_get` /
`_real_resolve_with_safe_probe` from `test_rearch_r5_production_decides.py`, `_run_turn_
engine` from `test_rearch_r6_review_round.py` - the SAME "real resolver/gate/narrower
over seeded Postgres rows, only the MCP boundary doubled" convention every hand pass 12
file already uses.

Postgres only (`session_factory`, blank schema). Every row seeded fresh per test; no row
is borrowed from another test or from any live/clone data.

    an escalation offer whose TEAM is customer_service must show the member roster
    THIS turn (pending becomes `member_offer`, no assignment yet) - never the plain
    round-robin `lanes/escalation.py::run()` handover every OTHER team still gets.

    Measured by tester 50 (see the hand pass 12 handoff, `.claude/handoffs/
    20260921T091118Z-rearch-tester50-hp12-reds.md`): `lanes/escalation.py::run()`
    has NO roster-fetch call at all today - the only existing member-roster read is
    `answer_bridge.py::_miss_question`, which fires on a MISS creating a NEW offer,
    never on ACCEPTING one. This pass measured the SAME thing independently
    (`grep -rn "escalate_offered" app/services/chatbot/turn/apply.py`):
    `apply.py:625`'s own `answer_pending_accept` arm sends a "yes" over ANY offer
    straight to `trace.lane = "escalation"` with no team-based branch at all.

    The feature therefore does not exist yet, and every assertion below is on an
    OUTCOME (the reply text, the actions the executor would run, the PREVIEWED
    session_patch) - never on which internal function got called - so it targets
    whatever shape the coder's fix takes rather than a shape this pass invents.

    owner correction 21 Sep: yes = round robin, roster rides the offer reply. The
    two-step above (roster shows first, THEN a follow-up pick/yes assigns) is
    WRONG and is retired by (a) and (d) below - a "yes" over a customer_service
    accept, with no member preference named, assigns by round robin IMMEDIATELY,
    the exact same turn, exactly as production (coder 44's own `engine.py::
    _run_member_offer_arm`, commit 8e4ecdac7, implemented the two-step; that arm
    must be reverted). The member roster rides in the SAME reply as the OFFER
    instead (see `test_rearch_r12_handpass12.py::
    TestGroupB2AMissThatAlsoEarnsACsMemberOfferPrintsOneNumberedList` for the
    did-you-mean-miss half of this fix; (f) below is the plain customer-pick-miss
    half). b/c/e are UNCHANGED: a NUMBER or NAME picked over an already-open
    `member_offer` roster still assigns that specific member (b) or round-robins on
    a bare "yes" (c) - existing, correct behaviour, read not invented - and a

        5..9 - the same fix as B2A(a), applied to a `customer`-typed roster instead
