"""Three live seams whose PRODUCTION shape the ported n8n nodes cannot read.

Follow-up to #700. Every fix in that PR is bypassed on production because the test that
proved it stubbed the seam with the shape the n8n NODE produced, not the shape the CRM
SERVICE produces. A stub that hand-builds the upstream node's JSON proves the port can
read n8n; it proves nothing about the CRM.

So every test here crosses the real seam:

* **H** - `services._mcp_call` builds `MCPRuntimeClient` and returns whatever
  `call_tool` returns, and `call_tool` returns a **string** (`"\\n".join(chunks)` or
  `json.dumps(result)`, `app/services/ai_assistant_service.py`). The fetch path parses it
  (`fetch.parse_mcp_content`); the four probe seams did not, so `answer.run_crossdomain`'s
  `probe_result if isinstance(probe_result, dict) else {}` dropped every probe answer and
  `crossdomain_render` degraded to `no_envelope`. The probe ALSO sent
  `sub-get-results`' workflowInputs (`entities` / `semantic_input` / `user_prompt`) as the
  MCP tool arguments, which the MCP server ignores: MEASURED against the local MCP on
  6 Sep 2026, `crm_incoming_stock_list` answers those arguments with
  `{"data": [], "total": 0, "page": 1, "limit": null}` - the raw list shape, with no
  `items` / `answers` / `has_result`, so it degrades to `no_envelope` even once it is
  parsed. The same call with `entity_ids_transformer`'s arguments answers with the render
  envelope. So the test asserts BOTH halves at the client: the arguments that arrive and
  the string that comes back.
* **B** - `services._family_fetch` returns `ProductService.list_products(...)`, whose
  `data` is a list of `Product` ORM objects. `jsc.get(row, "product_code")` returns the
  default on anything that is not a dict, so `sibling_transform` found no siblings and the
  D3 family offer was skipped. Exercised against the REAL `ProductService` on the
  Postgres fixture.
* **I** - the resolver reaches one customer by `customer_code` and another by
  `debtor_name`, both as `canonical_code`, on two different `customers` rows. The gate
  keys by uuid, so both survive, and `_axis_labelled_subject` printed the internal debtor
  code. Exercised against the REAL resolver route, the REAL gate and the REAL
  `output_structurer`.

Postgres only (`tests/chatbot/conftest.py`'s `session_factory` over
`tests/_pg_fixture.py`'s blank schema). No LLM, no network, no n8n.
