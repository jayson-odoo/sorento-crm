"""D14 audit (tester-first, RED): a dry run must be ZERO writes to business state, and it
is not today. `Envelope.dry_run` is `is_test or test_run_id or (mode not live)`
(`contracts.py::Envelope.dry_run`) and the engine's OWN write (`chatbot.turns`) already
stamps `is_test` correctly - what is missing is everywhere ELSE a turn touches that never
checks the flag at all. Six findings, six RED sections below, all in one file per the
coordinator's brief so the audit lands as one commit.

Every test here is expected to FAIL against the code as it stands on this branch
(`fix/chatbot-dry-run-isolation`, `= origin/main` at 749248eb3) for the reason stated in
its own docstring - an assertion, not a fixture error, an ImportError, or a collection
failure. That is what makes it a correct RED: the coder's job is to make each assertion
true, not to make the test merely stop erroring.

Findings, each traced to the production line it audits:

1. `TestIntegrationLogWritesRegardlessOfDryRun` - `app/api/v1/external/chat.py:230-249`
   (`/turn`) and `:378-421` (`/complete`'s `_log_complete_call`) write ONE `integration_log`
   row per call, carrying the real contact id and the customer's text, with no `is_test`
   branch at all. D14 says a dry run is zero writes outside `chatbot.turns`; this table is
   outside it. **Design tension, stated rather than hidden**: `test_chat_turn_endpoint.py
   ::TestDryRunEndpointZeroWrites` already asserts the OPPOSITE - that the call log DOES
   gain a row on a dry run - matching this file's own docstring ("every call writes an
   integration_log on success AND failure ... regardless of is_test"). The two tests
   cannot both be green; this file takes the position the brief asked for (skip the write
   entirely on a dry run) and says so here rather than silently overriding the existing
   test's contract. If the team instead prefers TAGGING (write the row, but stamp
   `is_test = true` so it can be filtered out downstream), that needs a new column on
   `integration_log` - none exists today (`app/models/integration.py::IntegrationLog` has
   no `is_test` field) - and this file's two tests below would need rewriting to assert
   the tag instead of the absence. That decision belongs to whoever resolves this finding,
   not to this test file.

2. `TestOrderingKeysSkipDryRunTurns` - `app/services/chatbot/dispatch.py:129/133/137`
   build `chatbot:seq:{contact}` / `chatbot:done:{contact}` / `chatbot:running:{contact}`
   from the contact id alone, with no test/live namespace. `engine.py`'s S7 branch
   (~line 747 onward) takes a ticket, waits, marks running and marks done for EVERY turn
   once `chatbot_ordering_enabled` is on, dry run or not - so a chat-console test turn for
   a real contact takes a real ticket in the same queue a live WhatsApp message from that
   contact is about to wait on.

3. `TestD15DedupRespectsIsTest` - `_select_turn` (engine.py ~416-444) and
   `_existing_turn` (~475-483) match a turn by `(contact_respond_id, message_id)` alone.
   A test-marked row therefore SHADOWS a later live delivery of the same `messageId`:
   `run_turn` (~742-747) returns `_duplicate_result(existing)` and the live message is
   answered from the test row's canned response, with `duplicate: true` telling the caller
   to send nothing at all.

4. `TestOperatorSurfacesHideDryRunRows` - `app/api/v1/system/chatbot.py`: `failed_contacts`
   (~185-243) aggregates over `status == 'failed'` with no `is_test` filter; `list_turns`
   (~123-171) likewise; `retry_turn` (~277-386) has no `is_test` branch at all and will
   happily re-post an `is_test` row's original message to the live n8n ingress via
   `reinject_envelope`.

5. `TestMcpToolPickRefusesWriteTools` - `lanes/business/fetch.py::tool_filter` (~87-124)
   picks the single highest-`similarity` candidate with no allow-list check at all. The
   embedded tool catalogue (`mcp_tool_capability_service.py`) includes write tools -
   `crm_it_support_ticket_create`, `crm_complaint_close`, `crm_order_cancel`,
   `crm_purchase_request_approve`, `crm_purchase_request_reject` - and nothing stops one of
   them from being the top hit for an ordinary business question.

6. `TestLiveTailSessionPatchAbsentIsPreserved` - `engine.py::run_tail`, the line
   `session_patch = sealed.get("session_patch") or {}` (~2758), followed by an
   unconditional `overwrite_for_contact(db, ..., state=session_patch)` on a live turn
   (~2786-2788) whenever `write_session` is true. An ABSENT `session_patch` key (the
   sealed reply carries no memory to save) collapses to the same `{}` an EXPLICIT reset
   would produce, and the unconditional overwrite then WIPES the customer's remembered
   state for no reason the turn actually gave. See `tail/compose.py:73` (`sealed =
   composed.get("reply") or {}`) and `tail/compile_state.py:132` (`seal()`, where
   `session_patch` is always the compiled `patch` verbatim in production - which is WHY
   this file has to STUB the compile step to produce the absent-key shape at all; nothing
   in the real compiler emits it today, but the engine's contract must hold regardless of
   which lane composed the reply).

Postgres only, via `tests/_pg_fixture.py` (`session_factory`) and, for the two ordering
tests that must observe real per-contact ticket keys, a real local Redis
(`settings.redis_url`, the same substrate `test_s7_ordering_and_offload.py` uses).
Everything else is stubbed at the seams `test_engine.py` / `test_s3_switch_and_complete_
by_body.py` / `test_s6b_fetch_lane.py` already established - nothing here reaches an LLM,
n8n, respond.io or a live MCP server.
