"""Registered divergences between the Python port and the captured n8n fixtures.

AC-005. A replayed fixture whose output disagrees with `expected` FAILS, unless the
pair `(node, fixture)` is listed here with the hazard id it belongs to and a one-line
reason. That is how "parity before improvement" (D8) is enforced mechanically rather
than by reviewer memory: a hazard fix has to be written down as a divergence before it
can turn a red replay green, and an accidental behaviour change has nowhere to hide.

`node` is the fixture directory name (`route-turn`, `output_exchange`, ...), NOT the
Python module. `fixture` is the file stem. A `None` fixture registers the divergence for
every fixture of that node - use it only for a hazard that genuinely changes the node's
whole contract, and say so in the reason.
