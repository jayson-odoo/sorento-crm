"""Registered divergences between the Python port and the captured n8n fixtures.

AC-005. A replayed fixture whose output disagrees with `expected` FAILS, unless the
pair `(node, fixture)` is listed here with the hazard id it belongs to and a one-line
reason. That is how "parity before improvement" (D8) is enforced mechanically rather
than by reviewer memory: a hazard fix has to be written down as a divergence before it
can turn a red replay green, and an accidental behaviour change has nowhere to hide.

`node` is the fixture directory name (`route-turn`, `output_exchange`, ...), NOT the
Python module. `fixture` is the file stem. A `None` fixture registers the divergence for
every fixture of that node - use it only for a hazard that genuinely changes the node's
whole contract, and say so in the reason.

# World-level allowances live in `tests/chatbot/worlds.py`, not here, and there are

# rather than excusing a key - so there is no per-world delta table to keep honest.

# Deliberate behaviour differences that are NOT per-fixture, recorded here because

# D5 (S6a): n8n hard-codes the respond.io workspace as `space_id: "364817"` in FOUR places
# inside `sub-resolve-and-gate` - the `get-access-types` URL, the `resolve-entity` URL, and
# both probes' `semantic_input` / `user_prompt`. The port reads it from the default respond
# workspace row instead (`head/access.py::default_space_id`), which is the whole of D5:
# "the respond.io `space_id` comes from the default respond workspace row".
#
# NOT a replay divergence, and that is worth stating rather than leaving to inference:
# every replay passes `space_id` in explicitly (`test_replay.SUB_REPLAY_SPACE_ID = "364817"`,
# and the node runners never touch it at all), so the captures grade the same value n8n
# produced. The difference is only reachable in production, and only on an install whose
# default workspace is not 364817 - which is exactly the install D5 exists for.
#
# The one behaviour to know about: an install with NO default respond workspace row gets
# `space_id = None`, and `resolve_active_access_levels_for_contact` then 404s rather than
# silently answering for the wrong workspace. That is fail-closed on purpose.

# S4. n8n has NO reply on the low_signal lane's setup paths. `sub-casual-llm` binds its

# resolver that will not answer does not reach `sub-error-logger2` at all: the sub throws,
# the spine's caller has no error output on that edge, and the turn dies with the customer
# never told anything. Zero captures on the arm since 1 Sep, which is consistent with it
# never having produced an item to capture.
#
# The port fails that turn instead, at `stage = casual_llm` with `branch_kind` still
# `low_signal`, and sends a FIXED sentence (`casual.CLARIFIER_UNAVAILABLE_REPLY`) rather
# than interpolating the exception: those messages name providers and configuration keys,
# and none of it belongs in a WhatsApp reply. The CALL arm is unchanged and still sends
# `sub-error-logger`'s own interpolated text, which is why the two differ.

# Not fixture-visible - there is no capture of a path that never emitted one - so this is
