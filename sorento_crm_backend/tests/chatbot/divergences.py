"""Registered divergences between the Python port and the captured n8n fixtures.

AC-005. A replayed fixture whose output disagrees with `expected` FAILS, unless the
pair `(node, fixture)` is listed here with the hazard id it belongs to and a one-line
reason. That is how "parity before improvement" (D8) is enforced mechanically rather
than by reviewer memory: a hazard fix has to be written down as a divergence before it
can turn a red replay green, and an accidental behaviour change has nowhere to hide.

`node` is the fixture directory name (`route-turn`, `output_exchange`, ...), NOT the
Python module. `fixture` is the file stem. A `None` fixture registers the divergence for
every fixture of that node - use it only for a hazard that genuinely changes the node's
whole contract, and say so in the reason.

    # OWNER RULING K, rule 4 (6 Sep 2026): a BARE entity turn is typed by the
    # carried domain, not by the model's guess at the token's shape. Four
    # captures show the old typing, and all THREE are one class: a
    # product-shaped code under a carried `order` thread, retyped `customer`
    # (`srtwc286`, `CSK11A`, `ib2700ss rta`). The retype only changes which type
    # the resolver tries FIRST - `resolve_entity_body` sends
    # `fallback_to_all_types: true`, which is the "the resolver then decides"
    # half of the ruling - so no answer is closed off by it. The cost is named
    # rather than hidden: those three reach the resolver as customers first, and
    # unfolded, because the separator fold in `_token_of` is product-hint-only.
    #
    # A FOURTH capture was registered here on the first pass and is now graded
    # again: `parser-15129616` is a positional pick ("17" against a numbered
    # list of orders) that qualified as bare only because the fork's token test
    # asks whether the raw CONTAINS the token, and "17" is inside `M2609-0173`.
    # It was a defect wearing a ruling's clothes. `_message_is_only_these_entities`
    # now matches by equality against the raw's own tokens and an entity carrying
    # an `ordinal` is never bare, so the capture is byte-equal.
    #
    # This is a deliberate divergence from the LIVE parser body: the hunk it
    # comes from (`_bareEntityTurn`) exists only on the unpromoted
    # `sub-semantic-parser-FORK`, and even there it does not RETYPE - the retype
    # is the owner's addition. Pinned by

# PICK WINS OVER FUZZY RE-RESOLUTION" mechanism widened `pin_types` / `pin_bases` /
# `pin_codes` and `_keep`'s own uuid check from this-turn-only `pins` / `pin_uuids` to
# carried-or-current `pins_all` / `pin_uuids_all` - a carried customer pick now REPLACES
# the resolver's own re-resolved rows for a shared debtor code, never merges with them.

# Not fixture-visible: reachable only when a carried customer pin's debtor code is
# shared by MULTIPLE distinct accounts the resolver's bare re-search returns (production
# scale - one code shared by 99 rows); no seedable-at-test-scale capture can show it,
# and no corpus fixture happens to carry that shape either (the 182 graded
