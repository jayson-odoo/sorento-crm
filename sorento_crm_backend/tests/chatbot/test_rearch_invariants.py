def test_a_new_ask_that_fetches_clears_the_stale_pending():
    """(a) After a NEW_ASK decision whose fetch ran, `pending` is None unless the
    answer itself armed one.

    Pins hand pass 5 turns 38/42/43 (owner console, contact 437264483, 2026-09-17
    05:27-05:30 +09): 'Incoming and stock CB2805A' left an incoming-stock roster on
    the wire; 'any markeitng forms?' is a fresh business ask that fetched a forms
    roster of its own (a NEW_ASK by `decide()`'s own rule - it names no entity, but
    the shape is the same class of turn: a fetch that runs while an older pending is
    still open); the recorded turn 43 ('1') answered the STALE incoming/stock roster
    instead of the forms list it should have closed.

    Reproduced here at the `apply()` seam with an entity-bearing NEW_ASK (a plain
    product code named over an unrelated open roster), which `decide()` reads as
    NEW_ASK unambiguously (`decide.Decision.kind == "new_ask"`, `why ==
    "names_its_own_entity"`) - the same class of message, isolated from any resolver
    ambiguity. `_answer_pending` (turn/apply.py) has five branches for what a pending
    can become; a NEW_ASK matches none of the first four (no position picked, not an
    acceptance, not a decline, not a negation-with-entities) and falls into the
    generic "nothing matched the open question" tail, which is written for CARRY
    ("the message runs as itself... the tail keeps the carried pending") but ALSO
    catches NEW_ASK - the fifth branch does not read `decision.kind` at all. Currently
    red: `new_state.pending` still holds the stale `product_pick` roster after a
    NEW_ASK whose own fetch ran clean (a single resolved candidate, no fresh ask
    armed - `plan.ask is None`).

    declare (`turn/policy_rows.py` DEFAULT_DOMAIN_ROWS, the real seed
    `chatbot_rearch_s0` writes and `Policy.default_policy()` falls back to) - never an
    `extra.*` kind (`state.Focus.extra`, the bag any kind outside {product, customer,
    warehouse, brand} lands in).

    Measured against the real seed rather than a hand-built fixture policy, per the
    brief: `resource_attachment` narrows on nothing (`narrowing={}`) and `incoming`
    narrows only on `product` (`narrowing={"product": "narrow_to_code"}`); neither
    declares `attachment_type`, the kind `product_attachment` alone declares
    (`narrowing={"attachment_type": "narrow_by_type", "product": "must_narrow_one"}`).
    Pins the same hand pass 5 precondition as R5's journey chain
    (`handpass5-eta-typo-and-attachment-carry.json`, case
    'attachment-turn-never-carries-its-xlsx-name-into-a-later-incoming-stock-ask'):
    turn 29 ('container setatus reports') puts an attachment-kind entity into the
    focus, and a LATER incoming/stock ask under a different domain must never carry
    it into that domain's own fetch.

    Unlike the journey chain (which drives the full engine and is red today because
    the customer-facing header-composition layer downstream of `apply()` still prints
    the carried filenames), this is a narrower claim scoped to `apply()`'s own
    `FetchSpec` construction - `_narrow_and_plan` (turn/apply.py) only ever calls
    `narrow_decide` for a `kind` that is a KEY of the domain's own `row.narrowing`
    dict, so an `extra.*` kind a domain never declares structurally cannot reach that
    domain's `FetchSpec.entities` through this seam. Kept as a real assertion (not
    deleted for being currently green) - it is the drift guard for this exact class of
    regression, the way `test_parser_schema_guard.py` is for the verdict schema: a
    future domain narrowing on a new `extra.*` kind, or a narrower helper that reads
    `focus.extra` outside the declared-kind loop, breaks it immediately.
