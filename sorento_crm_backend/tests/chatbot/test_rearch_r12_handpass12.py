"""Hand pass 12 RED tests (owner's 61 recorded live turns, `.claude/handpass/
hp12-turns-21sep.json`), written test-FIRST from the captain's brief and mid-task
owner rulings relayed by the coordinator. No implementation for any of this exists yet.

Four groups, each traced to specific recorded turns (ids quoted below are the JSON's
own 8-char turn ids):

A. Stale order facets (`focus.status`/`focus.document`) leak into a NON-order reply's
   own header, and into a non-order tool's own args. Owner ruling mid-task: "remembering
   is one thing, whether I use it is another" - the focus MAY keep the carried
   status/document across a domain change (no assertion on the focus itself); what must
   stop is a non-order domain USING them. `fetch.py:2379-2391` stamps "Here are the
   [outstanding|delivered] orders I found." onto ANY tool's envelope whenever
   `semantic_input.get("order_status")` reads "outstanding"/"delivered", with no domain
   gate at all - and `turn_runtime.lane_parse_output` (turn_runtime.py:522-534) is what
   projects that bucket off `focus.status`/`focus.document` whenever THIS turn's own
   verdict names neither. Turns replayed: 5fbc9ee3 ("INCOMING SRTJC1303-R", domain
   incoming, prior focus status "delivered"/document ["DO"]/domains ["order"] - reply
   opened "Here are the delivered orders I found." over an INCOMING block) and c21b0d35
   ("Srtkt31ss stock", domain inventory, SAME leak - "Here are the delivered orders I
   found." over a stock summary). The round-trip pin additionally replays the shape of
   3ab754ff ("casa sanitary ware sdn bhd sep delivery", domain order, verdict's OWN
   status "delivered") - a bare order-domain follow-up with no document/status word of
   its own must still print the delivered header and pass `order_status` to the order
   tool, proving the carry survives a domain detour and is re-used once back on its own
   domain.

B. Did-you-mean pick by typed labels/positions never reaches the tool. Turns 99c114fd
   (the miss: two order raws PS202609-0374/PS202609-0363, did-you-mean roster
   positions 1-6) then fff93d11 ("PS202609-0320, PS202609-0310", TYPED LABELS - the
   parser resolved them to `reference_positions: [1, 6]`, `reference_target: "result"`).
   Measured: `focus.extra.customer_order` gets the two picked uuids but
   `focus.extra.order` KEEPS the two missed raws, and `crm_order_management_orders_list`
   is called with `entities_in: 0` / no `order_ids` at all - the reply re-renders the
   SAME "Couldn't find some items" miss. Coordinator note (owner rulings taken since):
   PS202609-0374/PS202609-0363 genuinely do not exist on the clone (newest is
   PS202609-0334) - the miss itself is correct and is not under test here.

   B2 (new, owner ruling mid-task): one numbered list per message, numbers never repeat
   inside a reply. `tail/outcome.py::cs_offer_gate`'s own "g4-no-double-picker" guard
   (`gate is None or gate.require_specific is not True`) only protects the
   REQUIRE-SPECIFIC picker case - a plain did-you-mean roster is a DIFFERENT gate shape
   the guard never covers, so 99c114fd's own reply prints BOTH the did-you-mean roster
   (1-6) AND the customer-service member roster (restarting at 1, "Sandy Lim" etc) in
   ONE message, and the STORED pending (`open_question.after`, this session's own read
   of the trace) is "member_offer" - not "customer_order_pick" - so a customer picking
   by the position the text just showed them ("1") cannot even reach the did-you-mean
   roster. (a) below pins that collision at `answer_bridge.answer_for` directly (the
   function `_miss_question`/`cs_offer_gate` both live in) - the same level
   `test_rearch_r4_bridge_miss.py` already tests this seam at, and the only way to
   reach `cs_offer_gate`'s own precedence decision without standing up the whole
   chatbot_domains/agent/team roster machinery through the live HTTP resolver. (b)
   replays 87c55e9e's own verdict shape ("1 and 4", `reference_target: "dym"`,
   `reference_positions: [1, 4]` - a genuine ARRAY) over the SAME did-you-mean roster
   Group B seeds, pinning that a MULTI-position pick settles every position, not just
   the first. (c)/(d) - the "customer service escalation always shows the member
   picker" half of the ruling - could NOT be written this pass; see the handoff doc for
   why (no seam/model precedent exists yet for a roster-fetch double at the
   ESCALATION LANE's own accept path, `lanes/escalation.py::run` - unlike the
   `_miss_question` seam above, `run()` has no roster-fetch call at all today, so
   pinning "shows a member picker" as a NEW behaviour needs a shape decision only the
   coder/captain can make).

F. Customer pick header prints a customer CODE. Turns 42e57c4e (the offer, four
   customer options) then 002a8f5b ("2", picking option 2 - THREE distinct ledger
   uuids, per the live tool call's own `customer_ids` argument holding exactly 3
   entries). Owner ruling mid-task (changed from the original brief): "print the 3
   customer names" - the reply's own header must name every ledger the pick covers, not
   the option's own rollup code ("300-B094" in the live trace). Also: `open_question`
   must be CONSUMED by the pick (measured: it is not - `open_question.after` stays
   `customer_pick`, kind unchanged, in the live trace).

H. A missed leg of a multi-domain ask prints the bare `NO_RESULT_INTRO` ("No matching
   results found.", `fetch.py:1120`) with no domain or product named at all. Turns
   d16347c2 ("stock and eta": inventory HIT, incoming MISS, PO-rung MISS) and 92280f52
   ("stock and eta": incoming MISS, PO-rung HIT, inventory HIT - reply order:
   "No matching results found." bare, then the PO rows introduced as
   "Here are the delivered orders I found." (group A's own leak riding along, since
   this turn's carried focus was ALSO status "delivered"/document ["SO"]), then the
   stock block).

Harness: `test_rearch_r11_zero_stock_live_replay.py`'s own convention -
`test_rearch_r5_production_decides.py::_run_turn_with_mcp_call` /
`test_rearch_r6_review_round.py::_run_turn_engine`, the REAL resolver/gate/narrower
over seeded Postgres rows, only `FetchServices.mcp_call` / `AnswerServices.mcp_probe`
doubled. Prior focus/open_question states are seeded directly onto
`respond_contacts.session_vars` (the SAME raw-SQL convention
`test_rearch_r11_company_routing.py`'s own malformed-open-question test and
`test_rearch_r4_answering_a_miss.py::_write_session_vars` both use), never invented -
every wire key copied from a real recorded `memory`/`open_question` trace event.

Postgres only (`session_factory`, blank schema). Every row seeded fresh per test; no
row is borrowed from another test or from any live/clone data. No live parser, no
:8766, no API key.

    """(a) Turn 99c114fd's own precedence collision, pinned directly at
    `answer_bridge.answer_for` - the function both `_miss_question` (the did-you-mean
    roster) and `tail/outcome.py::cs_offer_gate` (the member offer) live inside. This is
    the SAME level `test_rearch_r4_bridge_miss.py` already tests this exact seam at -
    reaching it through the full engine would additionally need the live HTTP resolver
    (for the did-you-mean fuzzy match) and the real Team/AgentTeam/AccessAgentService
    roster chain (for the member offer) both live, which no existing fixture in this
    suite stands up; `list_team_roster` (the roster read) is doubled here instead, the
    SAME "the MCP tool boundary is the double" convention this whole file already
    uses one layer up.

    owner correction 21 Sep: yes = round robin, roster rides the offer reply. The
    captain's original two-step proposal (roster shows only AFTER a bare "yes") is
    wrong - replying "yes" to a customer service escalation offer with no member
    preference means assign by round robin IMMEDIATELY, exactly as production. The
    member roster instead rides IN THE SAME REPLY as the offer (production wording,
    turn 99c114fd's own second message: "To escalate, choose who to route to. ... Or
    just reply 'yes' and we'll assign automatically."), continuing the did-you-mean
    roster's OWN numbering (orders 1..6, members 7..11) - numbers never repeat inside
    one reply, and ONE pending carries both option groups (each option already
    carrying its own `entity_type`, `customer_order` or `member`)."""
