"""The escalation lane writes NO chat history (coder's own test, S5 decision 5 Sep 2026).

`sub-add-comment-respond` does two things when it runs: the respond.io comment AND a CRM
chat-history POST. It keeps doing both when the caller executes the `add_comment` action, so
a write here would DOUBLE the comment - one row from this lane, one from the sub - and the
second would arrive minutes later with a different author.

Asserted by ROW COUNT on the real (blank) Postgres schema rather than by grepping the
source: a count catches an import added three layers down, where a grep of this one module
would not. The source check is kept as a second, cheaper net for the obvious case.

Nothing here reaches an LLM, n8n or respond.io.
