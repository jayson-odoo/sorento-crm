"""AC-109 (H28): every enum the turn engine speaks is declared ONCE, in contracts.py.

H28 is enum drift: n8n declared `branch_kind` in the router, again in the Switch, again
in `escalate-catalog`, and the three lists stopped agreeing. The port's answer is a single
`Literal` per vocabulary plus this test, which greps the package for a second copy of any
of those string sets. A duplicated set fails and names the file.

The scan is deliberately dumb - it looks for the literal strings, not for a `Literal[...]`
construct - because a copy hand-written as a `set`, a `frozenset`, a tuple or a match
statement is exactly as much drift as a second `Literal`.

    a second declaration:

    * a decision ladder naming each member in its own comparison (`route.py` must say
