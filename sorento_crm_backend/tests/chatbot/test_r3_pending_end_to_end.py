"""R3, end to end: the tail WRITES `pending`, a later turn's head READS it (AC-201, D2).

`test_r3_dual_read.py` proves the head's reader (`output_exchange._offer_is_open`)
accepts the marker shape in isolation - a hand-built `previous_conversation_state` dict,
never anything the CRM itself persisted. `test_tail_units.py::TestPendingMarker` proves
the tail WRITES that shape - a hand-built `ctx`, never a real session round trip. Neither
proves the two halves actually agree once a real turn writes what a real later turn
reads off `respond_contacts.session_vars` - that is what only `run_turn -> complete_turn
-> run_turn` on the SAME contact, against the real (blank-schema) database, can show.

Turn 1: the tail composes an escalation offer (`branch_kind = "escalate_offer"`) and
`complete_turn` persists `pending = {kind: escalation_offer, team, domain}`.
Turn 2: the customer's raw parser output carries `is_affirmative = True` and NOTHING
about escalation being confirmed - `is_escalation_confirmation` starts False, exactly as
a real LLM emission would for a bare "yes". The head's own `post_process` step, reading
the persisted `pending` off turn 1's real database row, is what has to flip it, with no
hand-built previous-state and no direct assignment by this test.

    offer plus a six-name roster, `pending.kind = member_offer`, domain `order`), then
    "last month" - which PASSES, because a date window is a filter in any domain - then
    "rpacc", which came back `offer_hold` with ZERO entities and re-showed the same roster.

    The cause is upstream of rule 3 and is why the inventory version of this turn passes:
    a bare token with no verb is emitted `casual`, the casual arm wipes `entities` and the
    domain-continuity block skips casual outright, so by the time the member ladder asks
    "is this a filter?" there is nothing left to be one. Rule 3's own premise says what a
    bare entity under an open offer IS - a narrowing of the question the offer was made
    about - so the label is decided by STATE (an offer is open, an entity was named), not
    by whether the model heard a verb (D11).

    Turn 1 is SEEDED as the persisted offer, for the same reason as the TTL sequence above:
    composing a real six-name roster needs the CS gate and real team rows, and none of
    that is what this chain is about. Turns 2 and 3 are real `run_turn` calls against the
    REAL resolver on real seeded rows - which is the half that matters, because the whole

# Owner ruling B, console pass 3 (6 Sep 2026), as the REAL two-turn chain.
#
# `test_output_exchange_rules.py::TestOwnerRulingBAllOfThemOverPendingDymOffer` grades the
# post-processor alone, against a hand-built `dym_last_result_set`. This grades the whole
# thing: turn 1 asks about a code that does not exist, the REAL resolver's trigram tier
# finds three REAL siblings under the contact's own company and the tail persists the offer;
# turn 2 says "all of them" and must come back scoped to all three.
#
# THE HARNESS GAP THIS FILE HAD, written down so it is not reintroduced: `seeded` above
# inserts a bare `respond_contacts` row - no workspace, no `respond_contact_companies` - and
# `_stub_parser` pointed `default_space_id` at None. `engine.run_turn` resolves the
# contact's scope from exactly that pair, so every session the turn opened carried an EMPTY
# frozenset, `entity_resolver._company_scope_sql` compiled it to ` AND FALSE`, and the
# trigram probe returned nothing however good the seed data was. The rule-3 chain above
# side-steps it by monkeypatching `engine._contact_company_scope`; this one does NOT - it
# seeds the workspace and the membership and lets the production path resolve the scope, so
# the chain also proves that path still works.
