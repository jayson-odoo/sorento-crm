"""DO-ASK-SIMPLIFY rule 1: the DO list header names a customer company once, never ledger by ledger.

`documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-do-ask-simplify-2oct.md`, rule 1, as reconciled with
CUSTOMER-GROUP (#1441, owner ruling (b), 2 Oct 2026): the `Customer:` line names a customer
GROUP by its own name, once; a ledger joins a company line only through its explicit group,
and an ungrouped ledger prints its own full name. No `(N accounts)`, no `and N more`. The one
formatter is `ledger_family.customer_header_words`; the groups are the turn's
(`ledger_family.customer_groups`). The DO rows themselves keep their own full ledger name.

Pure function tests: no database, no engine.
