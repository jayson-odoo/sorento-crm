"""Chatbot stock ask v2 S3 fix round 1, Blocking 1 (R6 B1, R14) and AC-SA312.

Reviewer pass, PR #1247 S3 at e01ef5c2: AC-SA312's regex guard ran only over the MCP
presenter's item TITLE (`sorento_crm_mcp/tests/test_presenters_availability_lines.py`),
never over the actual WhatsApp text `output_structurer` builds - so `_availability_intro`'s
shared intro and `_item_line`'s position number (`f"{position}. "`) both reached the
dealer unguarded. `_availability_intro`'s old `_AVAILABILITY_NO` line ("Sorry, we do not
have enough stock for that quantity.") is a statement about OUR stock, which R6 B1
forbids, and is false for a `too_big` entry with plenty on hand. This file guards the
RENDERED reply `output_structurer` produces, not the presenter's item title alone.
Reviewer pass round 2, PR #1247 S3 at ae16ee35, Blocking 1 (the part round 1 left unfixed):
the hand-built `_availability_envelope` helper below never carries `last_updated_at`, so the
footer `output_structurer` appends at the end of every reply (`fetch.py`'s `_fmt_ts` +
`"_Data last updated: ..._"` line, fed by `StockService._apply_stock_visibility` setting
`payload["last_updated_at"]` for every policy mode, availability included) went unchecked.
`test_answered_reply_carries_no_last_updated_footer` below builds the envelope through the
REAL MCP presenter (`sorento_crm_mcp.presenters.present_response`) with `last_updated_at` set,
the way production always has it, so the footer is actually exercised.
