"""S5 (PLAN-chatbot-media-into-turn.md): the rearch engine's "a token nobody could
place is named, never dropped" rule (`turn/compose.py:355-371`) did not fire for the
owner's 14:34 turn (image + caption, two of ten codes silently absent, no "Couldn't
find" line - PLAN Evidence 3).

AC-1850 to AC-1853 (UAC section F). Reproduces the SHAPE of that miss - several placed
codes answered normally, several genuinely unplaceable codes (zero fuzzy neighbours) -
through the real engine + real resolver (`test_outstanding_lane.py`'s `real_resolver=True`
harness), rather than a hand-built `compose.py` call, so the test exercises the actual
seam chain the plan names (`resolve_kinds` -> `unplaced_tokens` -> `envelope_of.unresolved`
-> `compose`).

**Simplification flagged to the captain**: the recorded 14:34 turn (image + 10 codes,
2 unplaced) is not available as a fixture on this branch (no replay JSON exists for it -
`grep` across `tests/chatbot/` and `documentation/` found nothing naming `M496-GM` /
`MBF 9902` / the exec ids). This file reproduces the STRUCTURE (N placed + M unplaced,
zero-neighbour tokens) with its own seeded ZZT product codes instead of the exact prod
codes - the plan's own kill test (AC-1853) is satisfied the same way regardless of which
codes are used, and a prod-code-accurate replay can be added later if the recorded
verdict is found.

Current (pre-fix) wording is "I could not find {codes}." (`compose.py:371`) - already
close to but not the same as the plan's target "Couldn't find: {codes}." (colon, verb
tense), so every test here is red against the PLAN's wording even on a turn where
today's existing bare-miss line already fires.
