"""Owner hand test 26 Sep 2026 (PR #1247), slice 3: a resume that names some of an open
task's products narrows the task to them.

T5 "check stock SRTWC286-SH-UF" over the ten-slot SRTWC286-SH* task T1 left open (the
focus state the orchestrator's trace check confirmed: `task_resumed_stock_qty` fired and
nothing was fetched) re-asked all ten. It now asks only for the product named, and T6
"10" then answers it. A task written before slice 2 (sessions already holding a
ten-slot family task) is exactly this fixture.
