r"""The schema/prompt/reader triangle: every key the engine reads off a parser verdict is
declared in the schema, every declared key is named in the prompt, and the schema refuses
an emission the model invents that the prompt never taught it (AC-105, AC-1506).

Three separate guarantees, three separate failure modes for a customer turn:

* A key the engine READS but the schema does not DECLARE never survives a provider round
  trip (`assert_emission` in `head/parser.py` drops anything not in `DECLARED_KEYS`), so a
  reader keyed on it is silently reading `None` forever - a defect that never shows up as
  an exception, only as a customer question the bot never quite answers.
* A key the schema DECLARES but the prompt never MENTIONS is a key the model has no reason
  to ever fill - `additionalProperties: False` still lets it emit `null` for a key it was
  never taught to reason about, so the key exists in name only.
* `additionalProperties: False` on the schema itself (and on every nested object) is what
  turns "the model happened to emit exactly these keys on 488 captured turns" into an
  actual provider-side guarantee rather than an empirically-true-so-far accident.

The read set below is MEASURED, not assumed: every file under `app/services/chatbot/turn/`,
`turn_runtime.py`, `engine.py` and `lanes/` was grepped for a dict-get/dict-index read of
each of the 35 `DECLARED_KEYS` (the raw verdict dict is called `verdict` at its entry point
in `engine.py` and threads downstream under renamed parameters - `parse_output`, `parser`,
`out`, `q`, `semantic_input`, `qf` - as it is copied into `apply.py`'s state and further into
`lanes/business/*`; the file column below names ONE representative reader per key, not
every one). Re-run the grep in the module docstring's own commands below before trusting
this table after an engine refactor - a key moving to a brand-new file would not fail this
test (the check is "is this key read SOMEWHERE", not "is it read at this exact file"), but a
key that stops being read anywhere and a key that starts being read without ever being
declared both would.
