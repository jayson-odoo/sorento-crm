"""S6c fix-round follow-up (commits `a9baafd47..1a0419e19`): four engine-level paths
that round opened, driven end to end through `engine.run_turn` against the Postgres
blank-schema fixture. No mocked-away business logic beyond the injectable seams
(`ResolveGateServices` / `FetchServices` / `AnswerServices`) - MCP, the embedding
provider and the LLM are the only things stubbed; `run_until_exit` / `run_fetch` /
`complete_answer` all run for real, including the REAL `engine.complete_turn` tail
(compile-state / compose), which none of `test_s6c_answer_lane.py`'s own engine-wiring
tests exercise (they stub either `run_fetch` and `complete_answer` together, or
`complete_turn` itself). Running that tail for real is what this file is for.

Every assertion cites the AC / H id it grades in its own docstring or test name. No
regex over customer text.
