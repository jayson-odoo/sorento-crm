"""R3 RED tests, engine level - a real `engine.run_turn` through `_run_turn`
(`tests/chatbot/test_outstanding_lane.py`'s harness, reused per the captain's brief;
`tests/chatbot/test_sales_report_lane.py` re-exports the same name).

UAC: AC-1683 (turn/compose reached only outside the bridge's two arms), AC-1694's
pytest half (customer picker), AC-1697/AC-1698 (promotion tier picker + multi-select),
plus the coordinator's own add-on (a one-entitled-tier promotion ask never asks at all).

**Measured, live, on this branch (post R2 merge, `7c3ada3a5`), via a throwaway debug
probe run and deleted before this file was written - not guessed:**

1. A promotion ask that needs a tier pick (`access_types` returning ONE row, "Sorento
   Dealer") answers TODAY with `turn/compose.py`'s own entitlement-BLIND tier ask:
   `'Product: SRTWT7445\\nWhich price tier applies to you?\\n1. dealer\\n2. office\\n
   3. end user'`, quick_replies `'dealer, office, end user'`, zero tool calls
   (`captured == []`), lowercase option labels, EVERY canonical tier offered
   regardless of what the contact actually holds. Production (`answer.
   access_level_choice_message`, reached through `resolve_gate.run`'s real
   `access_check` entry R2 now wires up) would ask about ONLY the one entitled tier -
   in fact would not ask at all (see point 3).
2. An ambiguous customer order ask ("orders for hanlim", two same-named-family
   customer matches) answers TODAY with `turn/compose.py`'s own customer ask:
   `'Which customer do you mean?\\n1. 300-H070 - no DO\\n2. 300-H071 - no DO'` - the
   resolved CODE as the label, no "Please choose:", no company-code suffix. Production
   (`gate.run_gate` + `pickers.annotate_customer`) prints the CUSTOMER NAME with its
   company suffix ("HANLIM TRADING SDN BHD (SRT)") and the "Please choose:" line.
3. **The coordinator's add-on, measured**: with exactly ONE entitled tier
   (`tier_gate.needs_tier_ask` returns `False` when `len(entitled_tiers) <= 1`,
   `tier_gate.py:148`), production does not ask at all - it recomposes access_levels
   for that one tier and proceeds straight to the fetch. Today's engine still shows
   the SAME three-option, entitlement-blind ask as point 1 (asking is not gated on
   entitlement count at all on this path) - genuinely RED, not a green control.

Every test below either spies the seam it grades (`turn.compose.compose_question`,
`turn.compose.compose`, `tail.reply_ladder.compose_reply`, `engine.run_tail`) or
computes its expected text from the same production-function chain
`test_rearch_r3_answer_bridge.py` uses, so the assertion is never a retyped guess.

    """AC-1698: '1', '1 and 2' and 'all' each settle one/two/every chosen tier and
    run the promotion fetch per chosen tier. Graded on the CAPTURED tool calls, not
    on reply text. The 'single' case is a MEASURED GREEN CONTROL: today's
    entitlement-blind tier_pick already uses entity_type == 'tier' on its own
    options (it is not the bridge's mechanism, but `apply._answer_pending`'s
    generic single-position handling already works for it), so answering '1' with
    one already runs one promotion fetch.

    Captain ruling 20 Sep 2026 (second round): AC-1698 says the reply returns EACH
    chosen tier's promotions - it does not say how many MCP calls that takes.
    Production answers a multi-select with ONE promotion fetch whose `access_levels`
    argument carries every chosen tier's recomposed name(s), not one call per tier -
    so the answer-turn assertion is graded on the UNION of `access_levels` requested
    across every captured promotion call, computed via the real
    `lanes.business.tier_gate.recompose` function, never a hardcoded tier-name list.
    Measured, reading production (`turn/narrow.py:409-416`'s own `narrow_by_tier`
    "proceed" arm, `kind == "tier"`): `one = candidates[-1]` - it reads the LAST
    picked tier candidate ONLY, discarding every other one focus.tier carries, so
    `spec.filters["tier"]` (and so `_tier_gate`'s own `access_levels_recomposed`,
    `turn_runtime.py:1454-1468`) is a scalar, one tier, never several. `one-and-two`
    and `all` are therefore STILL genuinely RED: the union of requested access
    levels is missing whichever tier was not `candidates[-1]` (measured: for
    entitled `["Sorento Dealer", "Sorento Office"]`, `ASK_ORDER` puts option 1 =
    office, option 2 = dealer, so `focus.tier = ["office", "dealer"]` after either
    answer and `candidates[-1]` = "dealer" - "Sorento Office" never reaches the
    fetch at all). `single` stays the GREEN CONTROL it always was.

    Captain ruling 20 Sep 2026 (first round): the ASK turn's own `captured1` is not
    empty -
    `TestPromotionAskUsesProductionCopy`'s own green test in this same file asserts
    the ask's reply is stamped "has promotion"/"no promotion" per entitled tier, and
    that stamp can only come from `lanes/business/__init__.py`'s own tier_ask arm
    running one MCP probe (`fetch_mod.TIER_PROBE_TOOL`) per entitled tier, each
    scoped to that tier's own access level (`fetch_mod.tier_probe_plan`'s
    `probe_access_levels`). So the ask turn's own captured calls are asserted to be
    ONLY those per-tier probe calls - never zero, never anything else - and the
    ANSWER turn still fetches per chosen tier as before."""
