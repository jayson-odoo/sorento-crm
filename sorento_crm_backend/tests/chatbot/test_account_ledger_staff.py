"""Phase 2 RED tests - staff: "account N" narrows the which-customer lookup by Account level.

`documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-account-ledger-2oct.md` Design 6 and AC-8, AC-9 (owner Q4).
`resolve_gate.run`, right after `services.resolve_entity` and before `run_gate`: for a customer
entity with `account` N and a raw word, the customer matches resolved for that word whose
`customers.account_level` is not N are dropped (read by uuid). No `account` -> unchanged.

Tested through one real `engine.run_turn` (the harness of `test_customer_scope_lane.py`), the
highest seam the existing picker tests use. The asker is an UNLINKED contact (the generic
resolver path, the one staff take); the fake resolver answers the typed word with the real
`customers` rows seeded here, in an order that puts the level one ledger LAST, so a picker that
was not narrowed cannot show a level one name by luck of ordering.

Data (levels are the setting): SOON HENG HARDWARE [A/C II](2), bare(None), [A/C I](1);
SOON HENG TRADING [A/C III](3), [A/C IV](4), [A/C I](1).

Exact texts pinned (card Q4 / UAC AC-9):
  * "SOON HENG TRADING has no Account 2. It has Account 1, Account 3 and Account 4."
    (family label = `ledger_family_label` of the matched rows, levels ascending)
  * 'None of the customers matching "Soon Heng" has Account 7.' when several families match
