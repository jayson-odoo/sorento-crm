"""R8 RED tests, PR #952 - Phase 3 RE-CHECK findings (tester 39, 20 Sep 2026), written
BEFORE the coder's R8 fix pass, from `.claude/handoffs/rearch-phase3-security-recheck.md`
(B2, S4) and `rearch-phase3-reviewer-recheck.md` (MB-1, MB-3, SF-1, SF-2), both measured
against coder head `6aeed4188`.

**Zero live runs**: no journey runner, no turns to :8081, no OpenAI calls, no clone-DB
query - every test here is a pure/DB-fixture pytest (Postgres, `session_factory` blank
schema) or a direct call into the module under test. Every scenario seeds its own rows.

**Test shape**: engine-level (`engine.run_turn`, real resolver/gate/narrower, both MCP
seams doubled) wherever the finding is reachable that way; a few items are deliberately
function/DB-level, matching the precedent `test_rearch_r5_production_decides.py::
TestSilentPrefixFilter` and the security re-check report's own methodology ("unit probe,
no DB, no MCP") already set for "this item is about one seam's own contract, not engine
precedence."

# Item 6 (SF-1) - the tier-ask arm's own precedence over the crossdomain climb.
# INVESTIGATED, NO RED WRITTEN - see the handoff. `engine.py`'s own
# `bridge_answers_a_miss` predicate (`plan.ask is None`, ...) is independent of
# whether the fetched envelope happens to carry a `tier_ask_fetch` marker, so
# the ONLY way `question_for` returning None on that arm could suppress the
# climb is if `answer_bridge.answer_for`'s OWN later call (gated on `answer is
# None and envelopes and bridge_answers_a_miss`, not on `bridge_answered` or on
# whether `tier_fetch` was ever not-None) somehow still declined - which,
# traced through `engine.py:1925-1985`, it does not: that second call fires
# unconditionally whenever `answer` is still `None`, independent of the first
# block's own outcome. Constructing the shape mechanically (patching
# `turn_runtime.envelope_of` to stamp `tier_ask_fetch` and `answer_bridge.
# question_for` to return `None`) and driving it through `engine.run_turn`
# (the same fixture `TestIncomingMissClimbsToThePORungThroughTheBridge` in
# `test_rearch_r6_review_round.py` already proves reaches the PO rung) measured
# GREEN today - the PO rung tool is probed regardless, because `answer_for`'s
# own gate does not read `tier_fetch`'s outcome at all. Reported as a measured
# non-finding rather than forced into a red that would not fail for the right
# reason; see the handoff for the full trace and the exact code lines read.

# Follow-up round (tester 41, 20 Sep 2026) - pins coder 33's SECOND fix, commit
# `19d5f7789` (`.claude/handoffs/20260920T132023Z-rearch-coder33-recheck-round-
# report.md`, "Follow-up round - live F8 re-check"). The lane-added `require` /
# `scope_terms` block in `resolve_gate.resolve_entity_body` maps a leg off the
# INTENT alone (`derive_require`), so `check_product_attachment` /
# `check_incoming` / `check_stock` carried a described-set leg on EVERY turn,
# a bare code lookup included. With no class word to scope by,
# `resolve_product_set` answered the leg over the WHOLE catalogue and
# `references._emit_spec_matches` emitted that population as a third,
# whole-query resolution of ordinary product matches - measured live for
# "SRTWT165-FT CERT": 200 unnamed products on `gate.compatible_entities`, a
# 131 KB fetch envelope, and a 206-entity did-you-mean probe that came back at
# the tool's 50-row page cap, so `miss_suggest._annotate`'s own page-
# saturation guard refused to attribute the has/no-certificate stamp and the
# reply fell to the bare inline sentence (live turns 790d43c3-91a7-4229-8bd
# and 85e536be). The fix drops the leg when the turn names a product CODE
# (`gate._is_a_described_word`, called not copied) and has no class word
# (`product_type`/`category` entity) to scope it by; a described ask keeps
# its leg untouched, and a turn naming both a code AND a class word keeps its
# scope term too.
