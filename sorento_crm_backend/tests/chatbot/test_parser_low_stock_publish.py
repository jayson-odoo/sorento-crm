"""AC-74 - the low stock vocabulary reaches a LIVE prompt version (#893).

Console check on the lane stack, 14 Sep 2026: "low stock report" parsed as `check_stock`
and "reorder report" as a form lookup, with every pytest in
`test_parser_low_stock_words.py` green. The reason is the one migration 514 already
records - `ai_prompt_registry.render()` reads the PUBLISHED `chatbot_semantic_parser` row
and falls back to `chatbot_parser_prompt`'s constant only when no DB row exists at all -
so editing the constant reaches a live customer NOWHERE until a migration publishes it.

`TestTheOutstandingVocabularyIsPublished` in `test_parser_growth_r1_reachability.py` is
this file's model; the two halves it pins are the two that can silently regress:

* **the migration exists and carries the words**, read off the file on disk rather than
  off the constant it publishes, and
* **publishing behaves**: two new versions, idempotent on a second call, and NO LABEL
  MOVED - promoting is the owner's own post-deploy step, and a migration that moved
  `production` itself would put an unreviewed parser in front of a customer on deploy.

Postgres only (`tests/_pg_fixture.py::blank_session`) - the publish half writes rows.
