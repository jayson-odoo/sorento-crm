"""R2 - `PLAN-chatbot-answer-half-reattach.md` slice R2 ("Measured" + "Grant before
roster"). Written test-FIRST, with no R2 implementation to read.

Contract under test (captain's brief, 20 Sep 2026), pinned exactly:

- `turn_runtime.ResolveOutcome`: a FROZEN dataclass with fields, in this order,
  `resolved_kinds, compatible_entities, predicate, resolved_candidates,
  unplaced_tokens, spec_tier, unplaced_alternatives, payload`. The first seven are
  today's 7-tuple values unchanged; `payload` is the dict `resolve_gate.run` returned
  (`resolved`, `gate`, `aggregate`, `tier_gate`, `_exit_kind`), or `None` on the two
  early returns (no entities named; the resolver raised).
- `engine.py` stops hard-coding `branch_kind="business_query"` at the
  `turn_runtime.resolve_kinds(...)` call site; `resolve_kinds` itself must enter
  `resolve_gate.run` at `ENTRY_BY_BRANCH_KIND[branch_kind]`
  (`lanes/business/__init__.py:45-49`) instead of the literal `"resolve"` it hard-codes
  today (`turn_runtime.py`, inside `resolve_kinds`).
- `turn_runtime.make_tool_runner` must hand `lanes.business.run_fetch` the RESOLVER's
  real gate (carrying `gate_reason` / `require_specific` / `customer_probe_entities`
  when the resolver produced them), not the synthetic `{"compatible_entities":
  entities}` dict built from nothing (`turn_runtime.py:1115`).
- Grant before roster (SF-1): the sales report grant must be checked before the
  resolver ever runs for an ungranted, ambiguous-customer sales-report ask.

`ResolveOutcome` does not exist yet on this branch - every test that needs it fails via
an explicit `getattr`/attribute assertion INSIDE the test body, never at import or
collection, so the rest of this file (and the whole test session) still collects and
runs. No test here imports a name that does not exist today.

Postgres not required for most of this file (`resolve_kinds` / `make_tool_runner` are
exercised directly with `resolve_gate.run` stubbed, so no DB session is ever opened);
the SF-1 supplement reuses `session_factory` + the existing harness in
`test_outstanding_lane.py` / `test_sales_report_grant_security.py`, matching how those
files already run.

# report ask. What it does NOT yet pin (this round's own gap): that the RESOLVER
# itself - `resolve_gate.run` / `turn_runtime.resolve_kinds` - is never called at all.
# The roster the existing test proves leaks is BUILT from the resolver's own output
# (the `must_narrow_one` customer roster over `resolved_candidates`), so "grant before
# roster" has to move the check to before THIS call, not merely before the MCP tool
# call - a fix that only guards the tool call would leave the resolver (and so a real
# customer lookup) running for an ungranted contact.
#
# Reuses the SAME harness and fixtures as `test_sales_report_grant_security.py` and
