"""R3 RED tests - `app/services/chatbot/answer_bridge.py`'s `question_for` seam
(PLAN-chatbot-answer-half-reattach.md slice R3; UAC AC-1683, AC-1684, AC-1691's own
"no roster under two options" umbrella, AC-1694 pytest half, AC-1697/AC-1698's shape).

**Captain rulings, 20 Sep 2026, adjusting this file from its first red pass:**

1. **Bridge home.** The purity guard wins, no carve-out: the bridge lives OUTSIDE
   `turn/`, as `app/services/chatbot/answer_bridge.py` (sibling of `turn_runtime.py`,
   already the impure adaptor between the pure core and the old seams). Import path
   `app.services.chatbot.answer_bridge`. It may import `tail.outcome`,
   `tail.reply_ladder`, `lanes.business.answer`, `session_state`, `turn.pending`,
   `turn.compose.Answer`. `TestTurnPackagePurity` below adds the missing direction
   (no file under `turn/` imports `answer_bridge` or `tail`) - the `tail` half is
   already covered by `test_rearch_s2_apply_is_pure.py`'s own parametrize, so this
   file's own guard is scoped to `answer_bridge` (not a duplicate of that test).
2. **Access arm has TWO triggers, exactly as production `complete_answer:1578-1588`**:
   `if exit_kind == "access_ask" or fetch_arm == "tier-ask"`, with
   `tier_source = fetch if fetch_arm == "tier-ask" else payload`. Public surface:
   `answer_bridge.question_for(payload, *, fetch=None, parser, ctx, canned,
   asked_at_turn)`. `fetch` is the `run_fetch` fragment's own `fetch` item - measured:
   `lanes/business/__init__.py::run_fetch`'s `tier_ask` arm builds
   `item = fetch_mod.fetch_result({**payload, **collected})` (which carries `name`,
   `entitled_tiers`, `tier_availability` AND its own `_fetch_arm: "tier-ask"` at its
   OWN top level - `fetch_result` returns `{**j, "_fetch_arm": "tier-ask"}` when
   `tier_any_available` is a bool), then returns `{"kind": "tier_ask", "_fetch_arm":
   item["_fetch_arm"], "tier_probe": collected, "fetch": item}` - so `fetch` handed to
   the bridge IS `item` (the run_fetch wrapper's own `"fetch"` key), not the wrapper
   itself. `TestAccessAskArm` keeps the original hand-built `_exit_kind="access_ask"`
   cases (the "no access configured at all" arm - `resolve_gate.run`'s own exit fires
   only when the aggregate is EMPTY, see the class's own docstring) and ADDS the
   `fetch`-carried `tier-ask` variant, which is the real "entitled, must pick a tier"
   path production actually uses (`_exit_kind="continue"` + `tier_gate.tier_ask is
   True` upstream, then `run_fetch`'s own tier_ask arm probes each entitled tier -
   this is where the has/no promotion stamps come from).
   `TestMakeToolRunnerCarriesTheRealTierGate` pins the OTHER half of this: for that
   arm to fire live, `turn_runtime.make_tool_runner` must hand `lanes.business.
   run_fetch` the RESOLVER's real `tier_gate` (from `ResolveOutcome.payload
   ["tier_gate"]`) rather than today's synthetic `_tier_gate(spec, verdict, focus)`.
   Measured: `_tier_gate` returns `None` whenever `spec.filters.get("tier")` is falsy
   (no pick has happened yet) - PRECISELY the "no settled tier" case the general rule
   below covers; a pick already made (`spec.filters["tier"]` set) keeps today's
   `_tier_gate` recompose untouched. Not more subtle than that, as measured.
3. **AC-1701/F6 (attachment roster) moves to R4.** Confirmed: production never
   reaches the `offer` exit for `product_attachment` - `if_incoming_picker(gate)`
   checks `gate_debug.domain == "incoming"` literally, so `product_attachment` falls
   through to `not_found` and its roster + "has/no Product Photos" stamps come from
   the miss half (`miss_suggest`), R4's territory. This file's "offer/product" case
   stays pinned to `incoming` (the one `if_incoming_picker` + `annotate_incoming`
   actually implement today) - no test here expects an attachment `offer`.
4. `roster_cap` moved to `test_rearch_r3_roster_cap.py` with the pinned name
   `roster_caps: Mapping[str, int]` - not this file's concern.

**Pure, stubbed payloads.** No DB session anywhere in this file: `copy.fallback_copy()`
is the canned-copy object node replay itself grades against, and every payload below is
either hand-built in the shape the plan's own citations document, or produced by calling
the REAL production functions the plan names (`answer.access_level_choice_message`,
`pickers.annotate_customer`, `pickers.annotate_incoming`, `tail.outcome.escalate_catalog`,
`tail.outcome.build_outcome`, `tail.reply_ladder.compose_reply`) so the "expected" text in
every assertion is computed, never retyped by hand.
