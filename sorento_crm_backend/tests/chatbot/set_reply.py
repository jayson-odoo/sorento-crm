"""Readers for a counted-set reply, shared by the set tests.

Round 4 on PR #833 changed the reply's shape: R2 put each filter on its own bold line
("*Brand:* Sorento", "*Product type:* Wash basin") above the count sentence, and R3 made a
row "N. <name> (<code>)" plus at most one line of facts. The round 1 to 3 tests assert on
what the reply SAYS (the filters, the count, the codes); these readers let them keep
saying it in the words they were written in, read off the new layout.
