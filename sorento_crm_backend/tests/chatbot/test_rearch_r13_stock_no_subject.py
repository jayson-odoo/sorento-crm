"""R13 hotfix RED tests: a stock ask with NO placed subject must never call
`crm_inventory_stock_balance_list` unfiltered.

Plan: `documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-chatbot-stock-no-subject-hotfix-22sep.md`.
UAC: `chatbot-stock-no-subject-hotfix-22sep-acceptance-criteria.md` (AC-1790..AC-1796).

The live chain (prod, 22 Sep 2026 12:52, contact 423729104, turns 59-60):

* turn 59 "Srtwc8608-p-rl" missed and raised a did-you-mean roster. The token
  resolved ONLY as a `product_set` - a kind `gate.ALLOWED["inventory"]` does not
  take - so `turn/reconcile.py` rewrote its hint and `turn/apply.py::_focus_rules`
  parked it on `focus.extra["product_set"]` with no uuid.
* turn 60 "Stock" named no entity of its own (`entity_op: reuse`). The carry was
  handed to the resolver, which PLACED it (as a `product_set`), so `unplaced` came
  back EMPTY and `turn_runtime.make_tool_runner.runner`'s `would_be_unfiltered`
  guard - which needs `bool(unplaced)` - never fired. `compatible_entities` was
  empty (product_set is incompatible with inventory), so the stock tool ran with no
  filter at all and the customer got 50 rows of the whole book.

Pre-rearch behaviour is still the contract: `gate.ALLOWS_EMPTY["inventory"] is
False` ("a bare 'stock?' must ask which product"), answered with
`answer.not_found_error_message`'s own `needs_scope` sentence.

MEASURED while writing this file, and the reason T1's own carried subject never
reaches `unplaced` either: on a message whose every word is a predicate word
("Stock"), `api/v1/system/references.py`'s shape-B arm strips the query down to ""
and `derive_search_inputs` answers `understanding=None`, so its line ~2715 raises
`AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'bound_phrases'`. That call sits
inside `turn_runtime.resolve_kinds`'s own broad `except`, which degrades to "the
resolver did not answer" - `unplaced` empty, `compatible_entities` empty, the
identical inputs the guard hole needs, and the identical whole-book reply the live
turn produced. Pre-existing on `origin/main`, untouched by this hotfix.

Harness, all copied rather than invented - the SAME convention every hand pass 12 /
r12 file uses (`test_rearch_r12_phase3_fixes.py`'s own docstring): the REAL
resolver / gate / narrower over seeded Postgres rows, only `FetchServices.mcp_call`
doubled. Postgres only (`session_factory`), every row seeded fresh per test.
