"""AC-002: nothing outside the module's own doorways imports `app.services.chatbot`.

The package is module-private with ONE public entry point. It may import core services
freely; core must never import it. That asymmetry is the entire "liftable later" story -
the day the named trigger fires, the package moves behind an HTTP boundary and only the
files listed here have to change.

The check is a source scan, not an import graph walk: an importer that is never executed
by the suite is still an importer, and the failure message has to name the file so the
fix is obvious.

# trace screen is the chatbot module's own read surface, and its Retry calls the module's
# retry seam (`dispatch.reinject_envelope`). AC-257 names this exact path as where that
# endpoint lives, so the doorway is in the contract; AC-002 simply predated it.
