"""Hand pass 11, finding 1 - LIVE REPLAY. The owner retested defect 1 live on :8081
@ e242b2e55: "check stock srtwc6022:" did NOT climb the ladder, while
`test_rearch_r11_zero_stock_ladder.py` is 14/14 green. That file's own fixtures do not
mirror the live path - see the module docstring below for the two measured seams.

Replays live turn `8781cd47-a357-4c44-85bc-679527daa87b` (contact `437264483`, clone DB
`sorento_ai_automation_rearch`, read-only SELECTs against `chatbot.turns.trace`, no
journey runner, no turn to :8081, no OpenAI call). Everything quoted below is copied
byte-for-byte from that turn's own trace:

* `kind: "apply"` event's own `verdict` - ONE product entity, raw "srtwc6022", hint
  "product", canonical_code null, domain_hint "inventory", intent_hint "check_stock",
  routing `{"suggested_team": "warehouse", "suggested_agent": "general_enquiries"}`,
  `domain_in_message: true`. The SAME event's `state_diff.products.after` shows the
  REAL resolver settled this ONE typed token onto TWO real products by prefix
  ("SRTWC6022-SH-UF" 526f352f-5413-490b-a807-57fbd8772860, "SRTWC6022-SH-UF-NEW"
  ad52f980-441c-408b-954c-cc4ab42a1205) - a family-prefix ask, not a single-code one.
* `kind: "tool"` event - ONE tool call, `crm_inventory_stock_balance_list`, both uuids
  in `product_ids`. Its own `envelope` (below, `_LIVE_STOCK_ENVELOPE_JSON`, quoted
  verbatim) is the REAL presenter output: `result_type: "stock_compact"`,
  `restricted_fields: {"total_on_hand": "inventory.sellable", "location_on_hand":
  "inventory.sellable"}`, and each zero row carries a `granted_value` field
  ("0 (O/S: 5)", "0 (O/S: 0)") alongside a clean numeric `value: 0`.
* The turn's own `kind: "reveals"` event grants `inventory.sellable` (among others) to
  this contact - so `output_structurer`'s restricted-field swap (`fetch.py:2132-2148`,
  `_keep_field`) DOES fire for this turn: `f["value"] = f.pop("granted_value")`
  overwrites the clean numeric `0` with the formatted string `"0 (O/S: 5)"` before
  ANY zero-check ever runs, and no second `kind: "tool"` event (a real rung probe)
  ever appears in the trace - the ladder never even attempted a call, and no warning
  was logged either.

**Two measured seams `test_rearch_r11_zero_stock_ladder.py`'s own fixtures do not
mirror** (this session, tracing `crossdomain_zeroset` / `_rows_all_zero` / `_row_qty`
in `lanes/business/answer.py` and the restricted-field swap in `lanes/business/
fetch.py`), stated here because this is the diagnosis a coder fix needs - NEITHER is
invented, both read directly off the live trace and the code that consumes it:

1. **`crossdomain_zeroset`'s own `requested`-set builder drops a multi-product
   PREFIX match entirely** (`answer.py` ~line 543-560): `exacts = [m for m in prods if
   match_tier == "exact"]`; `if exacts: ...`; `elif len(prods) == 1 and
   canonical_code: ...`; there is no THIRD arm for "more than one product match, none
   of them exact" - the exact shape a bare family-prefix ask like "srtwc6022"
   produces (TWO real products, both `match_tier == "prefix"`, per the trace's own
   `state_diff`). `test_rearch_r11_zero_stock_ladder.py`'s own `_bundle` always hands
   back exactly ONE `match_tier: "exact"` match per typed code (a single-code,
   1:1 resolve), which can never reach this gap - `requested` stays populated in
   every one of that file's 14 green tests, and empty here.

2. **The restricted-field VALUE SWAP happens upstream of the zero-check, in
   `output_structurer`** (`fetch.py:2132-2148`), and `_row_qty` (`answer.py:404-412`)
   reads exactly the key that swap overwrites (`total_on_hand`'s own `value`) - once a
   contact holds the granting permission (`inventory.sellable` here), `value` becomes
   the formatted string `"0 (O/S: 5)"` and `jsc.js_number(...)` on that string is NaN
   (`jsc.py`'s own `_NUMERIC_RE` does not match the trailing "(O/S: n)" suffix), so
   `_rows_all_zero` finds ZERO parseable quantities and reads the whole row set as
   "says nothing about quantity" rather than "all zero" - even for a SINGLE resolved
   code, this alone would silently defeat the ladder. `test_rearch_r11_zero_stock_
   ladder.py`'s own `_stock_row`/`_stock_hit` never sets a `restricted_fields` key on
   the envelope at all, so `output_structurer`'s swap is a no-op there (its own gate,
   `fetch.py`, `if isinstance(restricted, dict) and restricted:`, is never entered) -
   every row that file's own fixtures hand to `_rows_all_zero` keeps a clean numeric
   `value` throughout, which is not the live shape once the field is restricted AND
   granted.

Harness: `test_rearch_r5_production_decides.py::_run_turn_with_mcp_call` /
`test_rearch_r6_review_round.py::_run_turn_engine` (both drive `engine.run_turn`
through the REAL resolver/gate/narrower over seeded Postgres rows, `FetchServices.
mcp_call` and `AnswerServices.mcp_probe` the only doubles) - `_run_turn_engine` is used
here specifically because it is the one variant that takes a caller-supplied
`attributes` list (`test_rearch_r5`'s own helper hardcodes `attributes: []`), needed to
reproduce the live grant (`inventory.sellable`) that seam 2 above depends on. TWO real
products seeded with the trace's own literal codes ("SRTWC6022-SH-UF"/
"SRTWC6022-SH-UF-NEW") so the REAL resolver settles the bare token "srtwc6022" onto
both by prefix on its own - no hand-built `ResolveGateServices.resolve_entity` stub, no
invented `match_tier`.

Postgres only (`session_factory`, blank schema). No live parser, no :8766, no API key -
`text_body`/`qf` replay the recorded verdict. No live turn to :8081.
