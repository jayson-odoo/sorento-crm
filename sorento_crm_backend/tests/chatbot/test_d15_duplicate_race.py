"""D15: two near-simultaneous deliveries of the SAME respond `message_id` (the webhook
producer and the failover poller are two injectors of one envelope shape) must produce
exactly one `chatbot.turns` row and one turn's worth of side effects; the loser gets
`{duplicate: true}` back, not an error.

**Real, committed Postgres via `SessionLocal`** (not the blank-schema `session_factory`
used everywhere else in this suite) - the whole point is what a SECOND, genuinely
concurrent connection sees while the first is mid-transaction, which a single-connection
rollback-scoped fixture cannot show. Same pattern and same reasoning as
`tests/scm/test_spo_conversion.py::test_f3_concurrent_create_calls_on_the_same_shipment_are_serialised_by_the_row_lock`
and `tests/test_media_quota_serialization.py`. Marker-prefixed (`ZZT-`) and cleaned up by
hand in `finally`, since nothing here rolls back.

**Confirmed finding (tester, not fixed here):** `test_two_threads_same_message_id_leave_exactly_one_turn_row`
(natural thread timing) is genuinely non-deterministic - one batch of 9 repeats ran clean,
a later run inside the full suite hit the same `IntegrityError` this file's OTHER test
forces on purpose, so it is marked `xfail(strict=False)` rather than left to flake CI red.
`test_forced_toctou_window_between_the_select_and_the_insert` makes the SAME defect
reproduce every time with a barrier inside `_existing_turn`: the losing thread's INSERT
raises a real `psycopg2.errors.UniqueViolation` / `IntegrityError`, unhandled anywhere in
`engine.run_turn`, which `app/api/v1/external/chat.py`'s generic `except Exception` turns
into a plain 500 - not the `{duplicate: true}` `ChatbotTurn`'s own docstring promises for
a genuine race. Report only; the fix (catch the `IntegrityError` around `_insert_turn`
and re-run `_existing_turn` to fetch the winner's row) is the coder's, not the tester's.
