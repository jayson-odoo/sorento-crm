"""#865 fix round 6: the n8n escalation behaviour, ported into the turn engine.

Owner ruling (28 Sep 00:2x MYT, PR #1300): "we did it in n8n and it was quite ok ady, we
need to put it into our chatbot turn". The reference is sorento-crm-n8n PR #23
(`n8n-workflows-init/plans/miss-company-routing-plan.md`, `tests/miss-company-routing-UAC.md`,
the parser fork's `output_exchange` rev-5 `_coCompanyPick`). Its captain decisions of
18 Aug 2026, as the owner's ruling restates them:

1. Partial miss on an order enquiry (one company has records, the other none): the offer
   is scoped to the miss company ("Would you like me to escalate to *Sorento* customer
   service team?") with that company's member picker; a bare "yes" or a number routes
   there (UAC M1, M2, M3, M8g).
2. Quantity 0 is not a miss: a stock or incoming turn is untouched (M5, Q1, Q3, Q4).
3. Both companies miss and a bare "yes": clarify the company instead of assigning from a
   default pool; a company name, code or alias reply ("mocha", "srt", "yes please
   escalate to sorento team") resolves the pick (M4a, M7a to M7c, M8a to M8c, M8e, M8f,
   M8h), deterministic first, then the parser's own `escalation.company_pick`, validated
   against the OFFERED pool.
4. Copy: a multi-company offer says reply with the company name (*Mocha* / *Sorento*) and
   we assign accordingly; bold group headers; no per-member (Company) suffix; a
   single-company phrase names the company (M7d, M7e); a clarify after an offer that
   showed no picker drops "a number, a name" (rev-3 copy, Q5).
5. Offer hold: an unrecognised reply while a multi-company offer is open re-clarifies and
   keeps the offer open (M8d).
6. An escalation whose offer showed no roster carries the resolved brand to next-assignee
   instead of dropping it.

Harness: `run_turn` against a seeded two-company chain (companies named "Mocha" and
"Sorento", so the n8n aliases "mch" / "srt" apply), the orders tool stubbed with the
envelope `company_scope.stamp_lookup_companies` produces, the parser stubbed, and the CS
roster read (`team_roster_service.list_team_roster`) stubbed per company. The escalation
lane is the REAL `escalation.run`, forced to a dry run, so the routing it would draw is
read straight off `escalation_context` / `_next_assignee_body`. Postgres only.
