"""Hand pass 11 finding 1, rung-block round - the owner retested the zero-stock ladder
LIVE on :8081 @ `d91e53fc1` (the commit that made the ladder actually climb) and it now
climbs, but the RUNG BLOCK itself carries two defects. Ladder turn
`27f60a71-a8c9-4d17-bd99-33f008d4207f` (contact `437264483`, clone DB
`sorento_ai_automation_rearch`, read-only SELECT against `chatbot.turns.trace`, 21 Sep
2026) is functionally the SAME scenario `test_rearch_r11_zero_stock_live_replay.py`
already replays as turn `8781cd47...` (same contact, same typed text "check stock
srtwc6022", same two real products by prefix, same stock envelope shape) - re-pulled here
because it is the turn where the ladder genuinely fired and its OWN `kind: "crossdomain"`
trace event shows the two defects below, byte for byte:

* `rung: "crm_incoming_stock_list"`, `rows: 1` (the probe's own tool envelope holds ONE
  item - ONE shipment, ONE line, for SRTWC6022-SH-UF-NEW only), yet `rendered` prints the
  SAME container/ETA/qty block TWICE, back to back:

      But there is INCOMING stock (ETA) for the requested products:

      - *Product Code:* SRTWC6022-SH-UF-NEW
      *Container:* IAAU1697450
      ...
      :rotating_light:  *(PENDING ALLOCATION)*

      - *Product Code:* SRTWC6022-SH-UF-NEW
      *Container:* IAAU1697450
      ...
      :rotating_light:  *(PENDING ALLOCATION)*

  Cause, measured (`lanes/business/answer.py::crossdomain_render`, ~line 888): a
  `zero: True` missing entry's rows are looked up by `code_key == n or
  code_key.startswith(n)` against the RUNG's own `by_code` - both zero entries in
  `zeroset["missing"]` (SRTWC6022-SH-UF AND SRTWC6022-SH-UF-NEW) match the SAME single
  `by_code["SRTWC6022-SH-UF-NEW"]` bucket (SRTWC6022-SH-UF-NEW startswith
  SRTWC6022-SH-UF), so the SAME row list renders once per missing entry - two entries,
  one shared bucket, two printed blocks for what the tool envelope carries as ONE.
  Production reproduces the SAME duplicate (owner's prod paste) - a production defect,
  not a test-fixture artefact.
* The zero note above the rung block: production says
  "No stock for SRTWC6022-SH-UF-NEW." (one code, the one the rung actually answered
  about). This lane's OWN reply names BOTH: "No stock for SRTWC6022-SH-UF,
  SRTWC6022-SH-UF-NEW." Cause, measured (`app/services/chatbot/answer_bridge.py`,
  `_block_product_codes`/`_RUNG_ROW_CODE_RE`): `crossdomain_render`'s own per-row grammar
  prefixes EVERY row with a bullet dash before the label line
  (`lanes/business/answer.py:938`, `line = f"- {field_lines}"`, so the printed line reads
  "- *Product Code:* SRTWC6022-SH-UF-NEW", never a bare "*Product Code:* ..." line) -
  `_RUNG_ROW_CODE_RE = re.compile(r"^\\*Product Code:\\*\\s*(.+?)\\s*$", re.MULTILINE)`
  anchors on `^\\*Product Code:\\*`, which the leading "- " defeats on EVERY real rung
  block, not only this prefix-family one. `_block_product_codes` therefore always returns
  an EMPTY set, `_prefix_zero_note`'s own `if rendered_codes and code not in
  rendered_codes: continue` guard is an unconditional no-op (an empty set is falsy), and
  every `zero: True` missing entry with a rendered row (there is no OTHER filter) is named
  in the note - both codes here, because the duplicate-row bug above means BOTH zero
  entries found a (borrowed) row to render.

Both causes are named here for the coder; this file asserts observed behaviour only, no
internal state.

Harness: the SAME real-resolver-through-`_run_turn_engine` convention
`test_rearch_r11_zero_stock_live_replay.py` uses (imported directly rather than
re-derived, so a change to that file's constants cannot silently drift these tests out of
sync with the live trace they both replay) - `FetchServices.mcp_call` and
`AnswerServices.mcp_probe` the only doubles, the incoming probe's own row rendered through
the REAL MCP presenter (`_mcp_probe_for`/`_present_response`, "production path, not a
shortcut"). Two real products seeded per scenario so the REAL resolver settles the typed
text on its own - no hand-built `ResolveGateServices.resolve_entity` stub anywhere in this
file. Postgres only, blank schema, no live parser, no :8766, no API key, no live turn to
:8081.

Owner ruling, 21 Sep 2026: the rung printing all 14 incoming fields (Container, ETA, ETA
Delay, CIDB Inspection, Loading, ETC, ETD, Liner, China Forwarder, Malaysia Forwarder,
Consignee, Free Days Available, Incoming Quantity) is NOT a defect - no assertion in this
file about which fields a rung row prints, deliberately.
