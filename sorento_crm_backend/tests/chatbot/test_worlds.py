"""World replay (AC-009, cutover gate 2): every captured turn, end to end.

Node replay proves each ported function against the bytes n8n recorded. A world proves
the WIRING: one envelope in, `run_turn` then `complete_turn`, and the reply, the quick
replies and the persisted variables must equal what that execution actually produced.
Everything the CRM cannot reproduce offline is stubbed from the capture itself
(`tests/chatbot/worlds.py` says which and why); the session read and write, the turn row,
the copy resolution, the outcome hub, the state compiler and the compose all run for real
against a blank Postgres schema.

**Multi-turn worlds are the only test that can catch a wrong CARRY.** Turn 2 reads the
session turn 1 wrote, not the session n8n wrote, so a lifecycle rule the port gets wrong
changes the reply two turns later - which is exactly the class of defect the operator
journey (D4, "so a wrong follow-up answer can be traced to the memory, not guessed") was
written about.
