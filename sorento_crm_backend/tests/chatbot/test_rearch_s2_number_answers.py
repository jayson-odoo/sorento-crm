"""S2 - a number against a pending roster resolves through `apply()` (AC-1522,
PLAN-chatbot-turn-rearch.md, contract lines 36/103/121).

RIGHT NOW every test is RED with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
'app.services.chatbot.turn'`.

Kinds and roster/offer classification: captain ruling, item 1, 16 Sep 2026 -
`PENDING_KINDS` / `ROSTER_KINDS` / `OFFER_KINDS` are the lane's eight names
(`product_pick`, `customer_pick`, `tier_pick`, `team_pick`, `company_pick`,
`member_offer`, `outstanding_scope`, `outstanding_detail`); `product_pick` and
`customer_pick` are the roster kinds that stay alive with `answered_positions`, the
other six clear on answer. See `_turn_helpers.py`'s module docstring.
