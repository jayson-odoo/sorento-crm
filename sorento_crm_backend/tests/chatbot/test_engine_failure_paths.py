"""Everything that can go wrong AFTER the turn row exists is recorded, never dropped.

Review B1: `parser.resolve_config`, `check_access` and `decide()` all sat outside the one
try/except, so a provider error or the stock predicate throwing on a contact with no
`is_allowed_stock` field escaped `run_turn` entirely - the row stayed `processing` with a
null error and no trace, and the endpoint's generic handler turned it into a 500. That is
H32's dropped turn, arriving by a different route than the one H32 named.

Review S2: a duplicate delivery returned `ctx: null` / `item: null`, which n8n's AC-110
re-emitters (`$('build-ctx').first().json.ctx.<key>`) throw on. The turn's answer is now
persisted and replayed.

Reuses the fixtures in `tests/chatbot/test_engine.py` rather than restating them - the
envelope shape and the stubbing seams are the same, and two copies would drift.

    RETIRED, not ported (named here so the rule is not lost): the "lane OFF" half of
    every original cell (`_enable(..., [])` / asserting `result.delegate == "business_query"`
    and `status == "delegated"`) - measured this session, `contracts.CRM_COMPLETED_
    BRANCH_KINDS` now covers all 13 `BRANCH_KINDS` (S7's own completion, already
    reached), so `chatbot_completed_lanes` no longer gates completion at all and no
    branch kind `run_turn` can route to is EVER left delegated - the identical finding
    `test_complete_turn.py`'s own header already documents for `complete_turn` itself.
    Also retired: `engine.decide` (the old dispatcher this class monkeypatched to force
    `business_query` - gone, S3 rewired; `business_query` is the real default route for
    `stub_parser()`'s own bare `_parser_output()` already, so nothing needs forcing) and
    `engine.business.run_until_exit` / `complete_answer` (the old lane-exit seams this
    class stubbed to grade the miss/failure split - `turn/fetch.py::run_fetch` +
    `turn_runtime.make_tool_runner` replace them, still calling the SAME kept
    `lanes/business.run_fetch`, which is what these tests now stub directly).

    Three cells PORTED, each measured directly this session (not guessed) by driving a
    real `run_turn` with `lanes.business.run_fetch` patched:

    * the resolver RAISES - `turn_runtime.resolve_kinds` catches it internally
      ("a resolver that cannot answer is not a failed turn: reconciliation simply has
      nothing to say", its own docstring) - the turn proceeds as if nothing resolved,
      landing on `business_query` / `done` with a bare miss reply. No delegate exists to
      send it to instead.
    * the fetch RETURNS an error fragment (`business._error_fragment`, any `outcome`,
      including `not_found`) - `turn_runtime.envelope_of` carries the fragment's `error`
      straight onto the envelope with no Python exception raised, so `engine.run_turn`'s
      fetch try/except never fires: the turn still completes `done`, answered by the
      ordinary miss composer (the SAME bare-header shape `TestUnknownContactFailsClosed`
      in `test_engine_company_scope.py` measures) - a genuine absence is answered, never
      left silent, whether or not the fragment names an `outcome`.
    * the fetch RAISES (a real MCP/infrastructure break, not a returned error fragment) -
      THIS is what still reaches `engine.run_turn`'s fetch try/except: `status="failed"`
      at stage `"looked_up"`, `GENERIC_ERROR_REPLY`, the branch_kind preserved. The
      customer is never told "not found" for an outage; only a genuinely RAISED
      exception, not any returned fragment shape, produces this outcome now - a real
      architecture change from the old `_fetch_arm == "error" and outcome is None`
      dispatch, confirmed by direct measurement, not inferred from the old contract.

    """`_close_turn` is write-once for a TERMINAL status, and first-write-wins.

    The sequence is real, not hypothetical: a failure inside the tail closes the row
    itself (`failed` at `remembered`, where it actually stopped) and re-raises, and the
    lane handler that called it catches the same exception and closes again (`failed` at
    `replied`). The second write names the CALLER's stage, so letting it win loses the
    only fact an operator needs. `delegated` is deliberately not terminal: it is the
    handover `close_turn_for_tail` writes and `complete_turn` supersedes with `done`.
