"""S3 parser prompt token ceiling - tester-first RED, from the UAC and the lane A
contract (section 6.3 "How the budget is enforced").

Covers AC-MEM061.

**Ceiling baseline, coordinator ruling 26 Sep 2026**: `CEILING = 37_153`, not the plan's
own 22,100. The plan's number is a `chars / 4` estimate over a DIFFERENT rendering (the
live n8n text alone, before this repo's own growth addenda and before this file's own
`bytes / 3` formula); 37,153 is what THIS file's own `_rendered_production_prompt()`
measures at commit `232182ae` (`SEMANTIC_PARSER_PROMPT` + every growth addendum + the
policy-blocks seed, `est_tokens = ceil(utf8_bytes / 3)`). The rule that matters is
unchanged - **the static prompt may not grow** - so the ceiling is pinned to today's
measured value rather than to the plan's figure for a different measurement. Any
S3 cut lowers the real number without needing a matching CEILING edit; a genuine new
addendum that must land raises CEILING in the same commit, with the new measured value
named the same way this one is.

**Ambiguity flagged to the captain**: the token estimator here is a LOCAL, self-contained
`ceil(utf8_bytes / 3)` (the contract's own formula, section 6.2), not imported from
`app.services.chatbot.turn.context` - that module is S3's own deliverable and does not
exist yet, and coupling THIS file's collection to its existence would turn a real,
meaningful "the prompt is over budget" assertion into an unrelated `ImportError`. Once
`context.est_tokens` exists, the coder is free to import it here instead (same formula,
same answer) - flagged as a choice, not a defect.

Pure Python: no database, no LLM. `render_prompt_blocks`/`prompt_blocks_hash` (which DO
need a database) are not used - "the policy blocks seed" is read from the already-
committed `tests/chatbot/fixtures/prompt_blocks_seed.txt`, the same fixture
`test_rearch_s4_prompt_blocks.py` renders and compares as its own golden file.

# 37,153 is the coordinator's ceiling (26 Sep 2026). It was measured on a rendering that
# appended the four growth addenda a SECOND time (`SEMANTIC_PARSER_PROMPT` already carries
# them), which counted 7,272 est. tokens twice (reviewer pass at d89110c0, S3). On the
# rendering a published version really has (`chatbot_rearch_s4._body`: the constant plus
# the policy blocks, below) the figures are: base 232182ae 29,901; lane at d89110c0 29,866;
# main 11bf373e 32,231 (its own `STOCK_TASK_ADDENDUM`); this lane merged over it 32,395.
# The ceiling stays 37,153 and is now measured on the right text.
#
# Re-pinned 29 Sep 2026 (fix round 7 on PR #1304): main moved the prompt past 37,153 on its
# own. Main fd521c20 measures 40,599 on this same rendering (+10,698 since 232182ae), grown
# by PRs the owner merged since the 26 Sep ruling: #833 (specification addendum and the
# code-first rule), #1273 (top selling) and #1323 (escalation confirmation). So CEILING is
# main's own measured prompt at fd521c20, and it bounds everything EXCEPT this lane's
# MEMORY_ADDENDUM (the lane's body edits save 179 against main: 40,420 at 8371dbee).
# Same day, second re-pin: main bc75eb96 (#1353, issue #1352 "a pick never overrides the
# message's own domain": one DOMAIN IN MESSAGE rule plus the open numbered question and
# stock task edits) measures 41,163 (+564); this lane merged over it without the addendum
# measures 40,984 (still 179 under main).
# Re-pinned 29 Sep 2026 (PLAN-po-spo-warehouse-29sep M3): PO_SPO_WAREHOUSE_ADDENDUM (the SPO
# routing rule, the warehouse cue under PO/SPO, the sort_by/sort_dir vocabulary) and the
# "SPO" -> spo_allocation in-body edit take the prompt without MEMORY_ADDENDUM to 42,356 est.
# tokens and the whole prompt to the 42,872 this test prints; CEILING is 42,872 - 512 = 42,360
# so both assertions hold (+1,197 over 41,163).
# Review round (same PR, reviewer items 3 and 4): the DOCUMENT section's second in-body edit
# ("shipment"/"container" name no paper) and the "last in names no sort" line take the
# prompt without MEMORY_ADDENDUM to 42,424 and the whole prompt to 42,939; CEILING is
# 42,939 - 512 = 42,427 so both assertions hold.
# Third re-pin, 29 Sep 2026 (PR #1365, CHATBOT-CUSTOMER-SCOPE, PLAN-chatbot-customer-scope-
# 29sep D2): `SELF_REFERENCE_ADDENDUM` teaches the boolean `self_reference` ("my" / "me" /
# "our" as the asker's own account, Malay and Chinese forms included) and is a genuine new
# addendum the owner ruled must land (grill Q5), so per the rule above CEILING rises in the
# same commit to the new measured value: 41,466 without the memory addendum, and 41,981
# with it (the estimator rounds per text, so the two do not add up exactly); the pin is
# the combined figure minus the addendum's own 512 bound, so both assertions below hold
# on the measured prompt. The memory lane's rendered body measures 41,390 on the same text.
# Fourth re-pin, 29 Sep 2026 (PR #1365 merged over #1373): both addenda in the constant
# (SELF_REFERENCE beneath ESCALATION_CONFIRMATION, PO_SPO_WAREHOUSE beneath that, MEMORY the
# tail) measure 42,906 without the memory addendum and 43,421 with it; CEILING is
# 43,421 - 512 = 42,909 so both assertions hold on the combined prompt.
# Fifth re-pin, 2 Oct 2026 (ACCOUNT-LEDGER): ACCOUNT_LEDGER_ADDENDUM (the `account` entity key,
# owner-approved verbatim text) sits between PO_SPO_WAREHOUSE and MEMORY and takes the prompt
# without MEMORY_ADDENDUM to 43,425 est. tokens and the whole prompt to 44,016; CEILING is
# 44,016 - 512 = 43,504 so both assertions hold.
# Sixth re-pin, 2 Oct 2026 (REPORT-ENGINE slice 1b, PLAN-report-engine.md section 11):
# REPORT_ASK_ADDENDUM (the `sales_ranking` vocabulary, 505 est. tokens on its own) sits between
# ACCOUNT_LEDGER and MEMORY and takes the prompt without MEMORY_ADDENDUM to 44,005 est. tokens
# and the whole prompt to 44,521; CEILING is 44,521 - 512 = 44,009 so both assertions hold.
# 1b code review S1 (same lane): the addendum's "not a sales ranking" carve-out takes it to 585
# est. tokens, the prompt without MEMORY_ADDENDUM to 44,086 and the whole prompt to 44,601 (+80);
# CEILING is 44,601 - 512 = 44,089.
# Seventh re-pin, 3 Oct 2026: restoring "SA" and "(dealer / project)" in REPORT_ASK_ADDENDUM
# (review round 2) takes the whole prompt to 44,603 (+2); CEILING is 44,603 - 512 = 44,091.
# Eighth re-pin, 4 Oct 2026 (owner rule: SEMANTIC ONLY, the parser decides, code reads no text):
# REPORT_ASK_ADDENDUM now teaches ranking_refine (a follow-up that only changes the count,
# period, basis or measure of the ranking on screen), the measure key, the new-ask rule and the
# product-ranking carve-outs, in place of the removed regex rules, and the live refine fix; prompt without
# MEMORY_ADDENDUM 44,788 est. tokens and the whole prompt 45,304 (+701, with the live refine fix, the
# how-many answer bullet and the people-ranking-is-a-new-ask rule); CEILING is 45,304 - 512 = 44,792.
CEILING = 44_792
# The memory addendum on its own, bounded separately so this PR's growth stays bounded.
# 26 Sep baseline (lane d89110c0): 339 est. tokens. Round 4 (baf4c813, 28 Sep: the history
# question in any wording, the number re-run, commercial_request) took it to 512, which is
# pinned here; returning to 339 needs a prompt cut, which is the owner's open decision on
# #1275. With the addendum in, the published prompt is 41,499 over main bc75eb96
# (limit 41,675).
