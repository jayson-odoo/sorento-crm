"""Owner hand test on PR #833 (28 Sep 2026 11:27 to 11:32 MYT, console :3083, contact
487555417) and the owner's rulings on the reply alignment page the same day. Fix round 9.

The owner's words (verbatim): "you do like here is what you want, but no incoming, do you
want me to escalate..., I want that structure to stay, i don't want so many route"; "need
to be more line by line, more structured"; "C: no cap, but no explanations and no
repeats"; "always break it down"; "I want us to reuse the functions that we have"; "i
don't want new layer, i want the layer to be existing one". And earlier the same day: "I
don't want too many new kind of answer format coming out just because of this reverse
asking".

So every attribute ask answers through the ONE reply the product-code ask already gives:

  * a hit is the product-code rows under one intro line naming what was asked for;
  * a miss is "Here's what you want:" with what was asked for, what matched line by
    line, what did not match, and one short escalate offer;
  * no explanation of how it searched, no repeated line, no typo mention, no silent brand
    default, and a set too long for one message gives its count and a breakdown by the
    next attribute, never a paging question.

The five turns of the test, in order, each replayed through `engine.run_turn` with the
real resolver, class vocabulary, specification registry and brands table (round 7's
harness); the parser verdict is stubbed as the published parser reads each message, and
the tools in their presenter shapes (round 8's compact stock tool).
