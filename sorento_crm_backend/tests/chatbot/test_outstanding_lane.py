"""Phase 2 RED tests - S4 lane wiring for the outstanding report.

`documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-chatbot-outstanding-report.md` "S4 on main" (13 numbered
wiring points) + "Tester's list"; `chatbot-outstanding-report-acceptance-criteria.md`
AC-1130 to AC-1142 (S4 slice). Written BEFORE any of the wiring exists - S1 to S3 (the
presenter, the route/service, the MCP tool) are already merged on this branch; this file is
about the CHATBOT LANE consuming them.

**Two ways a test in this file is red, both legitimate (see each class docstring for which
one it is):**

1. A literal/table assertion against code that already exists (`gate.ALLOWED["order"]`,
   `fetch.DATE_PARAMS`, the parser prompt text, `fetch.CHATBOT_READ_ONLY_TOOLS`) - fails
   because the entry is simply absent yet.
2. A behavioural assertion through `app.services.chatbot.lanes.business.run_fetch` (the
   real call site `engine.run_turn` uses for the fetch step) or through a full
   `engine.run_turn` turn with the parser/MCP/resolver seams faked, the same pattern
   `tests/chatbot/test_foundre_rung_end_to_end.py` and `test_pass4_item1a_team_clarify_
   consumed.py` already use for an analogous "the CRM decides, not n8n" mechanism. These
   fail today because `select_tool` always returns the domain's first-listed tool
   (`crm_order_management_orders_list`) regardless of `order_status`, so the fake MCP
   client below sees either the wrong tool name or no call at all.

**Tester's own choices, made explicit** (the plan/UAC describe the behaviour, not every
function name - same latitude `test_s6b_fetch_lane.py` took):

* The reply-composition tests (AC-1130, AC-1141) assert only the EXACT strings the plan
  itself pins verbatim in "The reply (contract for Phase 1)" / "Scope question (D2)" / S4
  point 12 - copy the CRM composes itself, independent of how the two-block REPORT text
  gets rendered (a question this file deliberately stays agnostic on: whether the MCP
  server renders it server-side via `view=render` + `present_response`, per S4 point 5, or
  the backend lane builds it - both are live readings of the current code, see
  `sorento_crm_mcp/sorento_crm_mcp/presenters.py`'s own module docstring above
  `_outstanding_report`). AC-1132/AC-1135/AC-1138 therefore assert on the MCP CALL ARGS and
  the SESSION STATE (`pending`, `selection_context`, `last_result_set`,
  `outstanding_filters`) - both unambiguous per the plan - and only require the reply text
  be non-empty.
* `outstanding_filters` (S4 point 4's own name) is assumed to be a new top-level session
  variable, written the same turn `pending` is (`tail/compile_state.py`), read back the
  next turn - the plan names it explicitly, this file just picks its shape (a dict with
  `product_code` / `date_filter_start` / `date_filter_end` / `customer_ids` /
  `warehouse_codes`).
* `services.resolve_warehouse_token(db, token)` (AC-1133) is a new function name this file
  proposes for "the warehouse resolver in `lanes/business/services.py`" the plan names but
  does not spell.
* `fetch.ORDER_STATUS_TO_SCOPE` (AC-1131's fetch half) is a new table name this file
  proposes for "fetch maps so_outstanding/do_outstanding/outstanding_both to scope
  so/do/both".

# (LLM) reads the answer and the head maps a POSITION to an option." A word
# answer ("all", "DO list", "delivery to hanlim") is now resolved upstream, in
# the PARSER - untestable by pytest (there is no LLM in this suite) and
# verified instead by the console run
# (`tests/chatbot/console_cases/2026-09-13-outstanding-report.yaml`). What
# pytest CAN and must still pin: the deterministic head resolves ONLY
# `reference_positions` (+ the `order_status` enum for a scope word in a FRESH
# ask, unrelated to this pending), the retired word table is actually gone, and
# a turn that also names its own entity is a new ask even if it carries a
# stray `reference_positions` (defensive - the parser is told never to emit
# both, the head still guards structurally).

# R15 (owner ruling, 13 Sep 2026) - a turn under an open outstanding question
# that PICKS nothing but carries its OWN filter (dates, a warehouse, a
# customer on a product-subject report) is a REFINEMENT, not an answer and
# not a new ask: the parser's own verdict decides it (`entity_op: "reuse"`, or
# `replace_combine` naming a filter on a DIFFERENT axis from the stored
# subject) - never a bespoke "dates-only" special case, per the owner's
# "too many hardcoding" pushback mid-round. The SAME report re-runs with the
# stored subject overlaid by this turn's own filter, and the SAME offer is
# re-armed with the new window/location - never re-printed unchanged.

    production can produce: `tail/pending.py::derive` returns a marker only for the
    `outstanding_scope` / `outstanding_detail` / `team_clarify` / `member_offer`

    ambiguous-customer picker (`selection_context: "disambiguation"`, no offer open)

    `order_status` to them, beside the `date_filter_*` / `requested_attributes` the
    session already kept, which is the key the head's `reuse` carry reads on the pick
    turn. So the seed carries `order_status: "outstanding"` and `pending: None`: the

# Owner round 8 (13 Sep 2026, live): `outsatnidng dealer quantity for chin chun
# product SRTKT39SS in 2026` -> customer picker (3 families) -> `all` -> the
# PLAIN order list for all three families instead of the outstanding scope
# question - `crm_order_management_orders_list`, a total miss. The SAME ask
# answered with `1` worked (armed the scope question correctly). "why when i
# say all for customer picker it didn't work, but when i choose 1 it worked?"
#
# Cause (traced): `entity_op: "clear"` (the parser's raw read of "all") runs
# through the ENTITY OPERATION EXECUTOR - the block that wipes `entities` and
# stamps `entity_op_applied` - BEFORE the "ALL/SEMUA on a numbered menu"
# structural arm re-labels the turn `entity_op: "reuse"` and expands
# `reference_positions` to every offered position. R16's carry (order_status,
# dates, requested_attributes, is_active - the `elif op == "reuse":` branch)
# lives INSIDE that same executor pass and never re-runs once the label
# changes, so a multi-pick "all" loses every axis the SAME executor already
# carries correctly for a single "1" pick (which arrives as `entity_op: reuse`
# from the START, so it takes that branch the first time).
#
# R21 (owner ruling, 13 Sep 2026): a did-you-mean pick, whether one option or
# all of them, continues the question the picker interrupted - the SAME
# carried `order_status` and dates apply. For an outstanding ask that means the
# scope question arms for the UNION of every picked family's `customer_ids`,
# same header (Customer line = every picked family, distinct, first-seen;
# Order date from the original ask), and `crm_order_management_orders_list` is
# never called. AC-1166.

# Owner round 9 (13 Sep 2026, live): with a single-scope detail offer open
# (`Reply 1 for the delivery order list.`), the owner typed `hi`, `hi`, `no`,
# `stop` - every one re-printed the offer. "wud i can't reset now?". Trace:
# `no` / `stop` parsed `message_type: "casual"`, `is_affirmative: false`,
# `reference_positions: []`, `entity_op: "reuse"`; `hi` / `hmm` parsed casual
# with `is_affirmative: null`. AC-1143(c)'s re-print (`_apply_outstanding_
# pending`'s arm 3) fires on EVERY non-answer with no exit except a new ask -
# `is_affirmative` is never read there at all today (measured: a decline and an
# unreadable turn take the exact same re-print arm).
#
# R22 (owner ruling, 13 Sep 2026):
# (a) A DECLINE (`is_affirmative: false`, no positions, no entity) under an open
#     `outstanding_detail` offer or `outstanding_scope` question CLOSES it:
#     pending dropped, `outstanding_filters` gone, nothing fetched, a non-empty
#     reply that is not the offer.
# (b) The re-print happens AT MOST ONCE per offer: a SECOND consecutive
#     unreadable turn (casual, `is_affirmative: null`, no positions, no entity,
#     no refinement) closes the offer the same way, and that turn gets its
#     normal reply. A pick or an R15 refinement still works after the first
#     re-print - unaffected by (b), since neither is "unreadable" at all.
# AC-1167 (decline closes it), AC-1168 (second unreadable turn closes it).

# `outstanding_detail` offer or `outstanding_scope` question, WHATEVER its
# entities' axes - `_outstanding_keeps_subject`'s axis test (R15) fired here
# because "customer" differs from the stored subject's "product" axis, and
# called a plain delivery enquiry a refinement of the OLD product's report. The
# pending is dropped (`outstanding_pending_dropped`), its filters go with it,
# and the turn runs its own path - here, a plain delivery enquiry for hanlim,
# `crm_order_management_orders_list`, no product carried, no `so_outstanding`
# stamped. A refinement stays the CASUAL-shaped turn (`message_type: "casual"`,
# `domain_hint: null`) that keeps the subject, exactly as R15 already defines
# it otherwise. Picks are unchanged. AC-1170 (a correction to AC-1157's own
# refinement definition).
