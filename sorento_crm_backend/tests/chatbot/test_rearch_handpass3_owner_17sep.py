"""Owner hand pass 3 (AC-1593), 17 Sep 2026 17:31-17:38 MYT, 26-turn console chain,
contact 437264483 (source clone `sorento_ai_automation_rearch`). One unit red per
FINAL ruling row - owner go, coordinator relay, 17 Sep 2026 evening, the UAC's own
"Hand pass 3 rulings" block (`documentation/plans/chatbot/chatbot-turn-rearch-
acceptance-criteria.md`) - superseding the earlier proposed-ruling brief
(`hand-pass-3-17sep.md`) where the two disagree.

Full chain recorded as `replay_turns/console/handpass3-owner-17sep-*.json` (5 files,
the coordinator's own natural sub-chains). Those files stay OBSERVED (currently-broken)
behaviour, not hand-edited to the ruling - see their own `_note` header and
`test_turn_replay.py`'s import-time comment for why. The reds asserting the RULING
itself live here, against the real `turn/apply.py` / `turn/narrow.py` /
`turn_runtime.py` / `head/parser.py` / `chatbot_parser_prompt.py` seams directly - same
split hand pass 2's own `test_rearch_handpass2_owner_17sep.py` precedent used.

**Rows NOT covered here, time-boxed, flagged not silently dropped:**
- Row 2 ("the answer header names each customer family once; 'all' over a customer
  roster fetches every family's ledgers") and row 6 ("the outstanding detail list
  carries the same filter header as the summary") are COMPOSE/reply-text-level claims -
  the header is built from a live fetch's own rows, not a unit-testable pure function at
  the `turn/` layer this file's other rows use. Needs either a compose-level seam this
  session did not locate, or a full `engine.run_turn` fixture with seeded order/DO rows
  (the `test_turn_replay.py` replay files above are the closest thing to that, and they
  already carry the observed-broken text verbatim for a human or a future session to
  diff against once the fix lands).
- Row 4 (date window) is WITHDRAWN per the final ruling: "the parser returned the date
  window; only the header was wrong" - not a red, nothing to port.
- Row 9 (97fb7b49, "2" after the promo miss) is hand pass 2's own finding 8, already
  covered by `test_rearch_handpass2_owner_17sep.py::
  TestFinding8AMissAfterARosterPickKeepsTheRosterOpen` - not duplicated here.
- Row 3 ("a message naming an entity of a kind the roster is not about is a
  refinement... carry the roster, plan the message") is SUPERSEDED by the final
  ruling's own "Current subject" line and the `answers_open_question` retirement's
  "no match = question stays open, message runs as itself" rule - both covered below
  (`TestCurrentSubjectLine`, `TestAnswersOpenQuestionRetired`) rather than re-asserted
  as its own separate row, to avoid two reds pinning the same behaviour at two
  different, possibly-drifting shapes.
