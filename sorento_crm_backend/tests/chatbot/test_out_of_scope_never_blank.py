"""Owner rule: a turn is never answered with a blank reply. The `out_of_scope` arm.

Crew eval, 12 Oct 2026 (dry run, test envelope): a "request_for_help" verdict with no
domain, no intent, ZERO entities and a null routing went to `out_of_scope`, and the turn's
reply text was "" with no error and no tool error. The only log line was the dry-run
escalation preview's known 404 ("No team found ... customer_service"). The same message
parsed with one customer entity went `business_query` and answered normally.

The lane DOES build the customer's one message (`ROUTED_TO_PIC_REPLY`, WA-MSG-TRIM) as a
`send_message` action, but the tail composed no text on this arm (`escalate-catalog`'s
`includeResponse: false`), so the turn's `reply.text` - what the console, the eval, the
next turn's `Previous response:` and the chat-history link all read - was null.

Driven through `engine.run_turn` with the harness's `mock_reformulator_output` (G6), so
nothing reaches an LLM. Postgres only, blank schema, via `tests/chatbot/conftest.py`.
