"""AC-1 to AC-6: the business lane picks its tool from `DOMAIN_SPEC`, not from a vector.

Written BEFORE the change (Phase 2, test-first). The red reason every test below should
fail with today is the OLD contract: `select_tool(db, *, query, domain, services)` embeds
the customer's message and asks `EmbeddingReadService.search_tool_chunks` for the nearest
`mcp_tool` chunk. A failure for any other reason is a defect in this file.

Why the pick is a table read now, measured rather than argued (see
`documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-chatbot-drop-tool-rag.md`): over every business turn in
the 7 Sep 2026 prod copy (`sorento_ai_automation_0907`, `chatbot.turns.trace`
`_tool_pick.chosen`, 740 turns) the pick was the domain's FIRST-LISTED tool on every
single turn, and not one of the twelve variants was ever chosen. The vector search was
deciding a question with one answer, at the cost of one embedding call per turn and a
runtime dependency on a seeding chain that cannot run in the deployed backend image (the
MCP catalogue is not in it), so production's tool RAG has been frozen since 2 June 2026
and every tool added since was unreachable.
