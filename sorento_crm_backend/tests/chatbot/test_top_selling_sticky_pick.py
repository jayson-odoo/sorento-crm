"""Top X hot selling (#1171): the ranked list is a sticky pick list, the same as the
customer picker and the product picker (owner, PR #1258, 26 Sep 2026 05:32Z: "make sure
the list of choice behave similarly to our other picker like customer picker, product
picker, that it will be sticky to a certain extent").

Reuses the pickers' OWN mechanism, no second one:

* `turn/pending.py::ROSTER_KINDS` - `top_selling_pick` sits beside `product_pick` and
  `customer_pick`, so it survives its own pick (`with_answered_positions`) and has no
  turn clock (`tick` only expires the escalation offers).
* `turn/decide.py::picked_positions` - a bare "2" arrives as `reference_positions`, a
  typed code or category name matches the option's label exactly.
* `turn/apply.py` - the same close rules: a list whose every row was picked closes on
  entry (pinned below), and a new ask about something else closes it
  (`new_ask_closes_stale_roster`, which reads no kind, so it is inherited as is and pinned
  by the pickers' own tests rather than again here).

The rows come from the MCP envelope's `result_set` (`presenters._top_selling_envelope`),
one per printed line, `idx` = the printed rank.
