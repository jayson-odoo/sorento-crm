"""Phase 2 RED tests - the fetch layer forces a scoped contact's `customer_ids` (D4).

`documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-chatbot-customer-scope-29sep.md` D4 and
`chatbot-customer-scope-29sep-acceptance-criteria.md` AC-CS-31 and AC-CS-32.

`fetch.entity_ids_transformer`, given `semantic_input.scope_customer_ids`, forces
`customer_ids` on every tool in `fetch.CUSTOMER_SCOPED_TOOLS`; `fetch.ScopeViolation` is
raised (no call made) for any requested id outside the scope. The set itself is pinned to
the MCP catalogue so a new tool taking `customer_ids` fails here until it is classified.
