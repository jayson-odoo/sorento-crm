"""CA-3 security finding at 8c02a225d, RED: the chat report's asker-rule scope (dealer only) must
not leak onto the other asks of a multi-ask turn.

A contact with customer links that classifies SALESPERSON (active user, role slug `salesperson`,
no office access type) is customer-scoped by the generic rule for an orders ask (main behaviour):
a customer word outside its links is refused ("That isn't under your account..."). A turn
that ALSO carries a chat report must not change that, and a contact without the
`chatbot.analytics` reveal must not trigger the chat scoping at all. Parser and MCP are fakes.
