"""R4 RED tests, engine/production-chain level - the customer-facing miss shapes
(PLAN-chatbot-answer-half-reattach.md slice R4; UAC AC-1683, AC-1699 to AC-1705, AC-1708).

**Scope note (captain's brief: "if a phase genuinely cannot be done, say so").** AC-1699's
own dated-order-miss scenario and AC-1701/AC-1702's attachment scenarios are graded here at
the PRODUCTION-CHAIN level (calling the real `not_found_error_message` / `run_miss_lane` /
`escalate_catalog` / `compose_from_fragments` chain, or the real DB-backed picker-stamp
harness) rather than through a full `engine.run_turn` turn, for two measured reasons:

1. **AC-1699/AC-1700's "position assigns that member" / "yes assigns automatically" /
   "all dates re-runs the fetch"** live in `turn/apply.py::_answer_pending`'s generic pick
   resolution, a SEPARATE surface from the bridge this file's own remit is (`answer_bridge.
   answer_for`). Pinning THAT would need `turn/apply.py`'s own contract for a `member_offer`
   Pending, which does not exist yet either (confirmed: `pending.PENDING_KINDS` carries
   `member_offer` read-side only, per the plan's own measured fact) - out of scope for a
   red-tests-for-R4 pass; flagged here as the next slice's own territory, not silently
   dropped. `test_rearch_r4_bridge_miss.py::TestMemberOfferPendingIsMintedByTheBridge`
   already pins the WRITE side (the Pending itself, its options, its team) - this file adds
   the CUSTOMER-FACING SCOPE BLOCK text (AC-1699's own bullets) that Pending sits under.
2. **AC-1701/AC-1702** reuse `test_product_attachment_picker_stamp.py`'s own real-DB
   harness (seeded products/attachment types/files, real gate/resolver/`dym_transform`/
   `dym_annotate`, only the MCP call stubbed) - the brief's own named precedent - rather
   than re-deriving the same fixture through `_run_turn`'s fully-faked resolver, so a
   genuine has/no split is graded against real rows, not a hand-typed roster.

Every "expected" value below is computed by calling the real production function chain,
never retyped copy - the SAME convention `test_rearch_r4_bridge_miss.py` uses.

    a THIRD stage `engine.run_tail`/`complete_turn` never actually calls today (confirmed:
    the only caller anywhere in `app/` is `tests/chatbot/test_replay.py`'s own replay
    harness - it is dead code on BOTH the pre-rearch business_query lane and the new turn
    engine). `answer.run_crossdomain` itself is ALSO dead on the new engine path
    (its own docstring: "NOT ON THE TURN PATH since the re-architecture ... Contract 3
    and 125's rung walk is turn/fetch.py::_climb now"). So AC-1705 needs the bridge to run
    BOTH pieces itself for a single-domain miss: fold `crossdomain_render`'s block through
    the SAME machinery `run_crossdomain` uses, then post-process the composed reply with
