"""R7 RED tests - live parity replay, PR #952 chatbot turn engine re-architecture.

Tester 37 (20 Sep 2026). The captain ran ONE live parity pass on the lane stack at coder
head `13e4977a2` (`.claude/handoffs/rearch-parity-live-13e4977a2.log`); 5 replies were not
production's. This file turns each into an engine-level RED pytest by REPLAYING the
parser verdict already recorded for that live turn against the clone DB
`sorento_ai_automation_rearch` (`chatbot.turns`, turn ids named per item below) - no
further OpenAI call is needed, and none was made writing this file (zero live runs, no
`scripts/chatbot_journey.py`, no turns to :8081).

**Test shape**: every test drives `engine.run_turn` (`test_rearch_r5_production_decides.py`'s
own `_run_turn_real` / `_run_turn_with_mcp_call`, real resolver/gate/narrower over seeded
Postgres rows) doubling only the two MCP seams (`FetchServices.mcp_call` and
`AnswerServices.mcp_probe` via `_mcp_probe_for`) - never `answer_bridge.answer_for` called
directly, and no hand-built `payload["_exit_kind"]`, matching every other rearch red-test
file's own convention (a unit test that bypasses `engine.py`'s precedence never catches a
precedence bug).

Postgres only (`session_factory`, blank schema). Every row seeded fresh per test; nothing
borrowed from the clone DB beyond the VERDICT SHAPE (uuids/codes are re-pointed at rows
seeded here, per the brief - CI's DB is empty).

# Real `attachment_types` row wording (tester 38, 20 Sep 2026 - captain's own measurement
# of the production data, not invented). `_prefix_probe_attachment_type` matches a token
# against `description` too (entity_resolver.py:2410-2515), so a seed whose description
# reads "<Name>, seeded by ZZT" is reachable only from a token that already IS the type's
# own name - the real rows are reachable from the parser's shorthand words ("certificate",
# "photo", "drawing", ...) because their descriptions actually carry those words. Only
# `description` (and, for Certification, `is_certificate`) differs from production; `code`
# stays NULL, matching the model default (`app/models/resources.py:44`, nullable, no
# default) - the real rows carry no `code` either, exactly as the coder's own measurement
# ("`_seed_attachment_type`'s `code=None` ... is the reason it is a gap for Certification")

# different things, confirmed at answer.py:691-693). The recorded verdict for
# this turn is `message_type: "casual", domain_hint: null, entities: []` (a bare
# reference pick carries no restated domain) - so the `domain_hint ==
# "product_attachment"` branch is never entered, and control falls to the
# generic `elif use_breakdown: build_breakdown_msg(f"{status_label}{jsc.js_string
# (domain_hint)}")` (answer.py:3463-3466), where `jsc.js_string(None)` is the
# literal JS string `"null"` (`jsc.py:47-48`, `String(null)`) - printed as the
# domain word verbatim, even though the SAME turn's own breakdown bullet
# ("attachment_type: Product Photos") proves the resolved label was known via

# (canonical_code "certificate") -> `derive_require` (predicate.py:192-193, every
# raw word in `_BARE_CERT_WORDS`) returns the BARE leg `{"certificate": True}`.
# `answer.py::build_suggest_offer`'s D1 arm (line 4157) is NOT `any_uuid` here
# (the near-miss candidates are real product codes, not promotion uuids), so it
# takes the "else: # Code mode" branch (line 4217) - `dym_annotate_on` (line
# 4223) decides stamped-numbered ("Did you mean:\n1. ... - has/no X", line

#
# MEASURED root cause (this session, via `_spy_resolve_payload`):
# `gate_debug.domain` reads correctly as `"product_attachment"` (the earlier
# hypothesis that `DOMAIN_PROBE`'s own domain lookup misses is WRONG - noted
# for the coder). The real cause is one step later: `miss_suggest.py:669-678`,
# `_scoping_from(cfg["requires"], gate=g, resolved=r)` (`requires =
# ["attachment_type", "certificate"]`) needs a REAL, uuid-carrying resolver
# match whose own `entity_type` is `"attachment_type"` or `"certificate"` - a
# BARE certificate leg (`derive_require`'s `{"certificate": True}`, no
# attachment_type ENTITY the resolver actually matched to a real
# `AttachmentType` row/uuid) never produces one, so `len(scoping) == 0`,
# `probe_skip_reason = "no_scoping_entity"` (miss_suggest.py:677), the probe
# never runs, and `dym_annotate_on` stays False - "photo" stamps correctly
# elsewhere in this corpus (F6/F7) because it resolves to a real, uuid'd
# "Product Photos" `AttachmentType` match; the bare word "cert"/"certificate"
# structurally never can, on this measured mechanism.

# Item 3 - AC-1704 (F8 answers): replying "1" (or the typed code) to the
# certificate did-you-mean must continue the ORIGINAL certificate ask for that
# product with a real fetch - never the bare "No matching results found." live
# turn `71a34056-338a-4441-8c02-4bb786d0818f` printed, and the answered roster
# itself must not linger afterwards (contract 36).
#
# Recorded verdict for the "1" turn: `message_type: "casual", reference_target:
# "dym", entities: [], entity_op: "reuse"` - a bare reference pick with NO
# restated domain, exactly `TestAC1704ContinuingTheOriginalAsk`'s own
# `product_attachment` scenario (`test_rearch_r4_answering_a_miss.py:476-508`) -
# reused verbatim here (`_seed_bare_contact`/`_write_session_vars`/`Focus.extra`
# carries `attachment_type` forward the same way), with the roster's OWN 3 real
# SRTWT165-family options instead of that file's synthetic 2-option one.
#
# MEASURED (this session): with the Pending/focus hand-seeded in the ALREADY
# CORRECT shape (`kind="product_pick"`, `payload.domain="product_attachment"`,
# `focus.extra["attachment_type"]` carried), the ANSWERING mechanism itself
# (`turn/apply.py`'s contract-121 pick-continuation path) already runs the real
# fetch scoped to the picked uuid correctly - a GREEN CONTROL, both parametrized
# arms (position and typed code). The live turn's bare "No matching results
# found." is therefore NOT this mechanism failing to answer a well-formed
# roster; it is a downstream CONSEQUENCE of item 2's minting defect (the
# certificate ask never reaches the correctly-shaped stamped `product_pick`
# roster live, so whatever WAS minted for the inline-sentence form the
# customer actually saw was not in the shape this answering mechanism expects).
# Kept in this file as the control that isolates the two defects from each
# other, per the brief's own item 2/3 split.

# Item 4 - AC-1703 (F8 "Technical drawings sttwc286-SH"): an unrecognised
# attachment-type word paired with an unresolved-but-near-matching product in
# the SAME message. Live turn `0d4abc93-2d53-483c-a56b-9974bf8429e3` answers the
# document-type clarify ("I don't know 'Technical drawings' as a document type.
# Types I know: ..."); the owner's paste says production instead answers the
# PRODUCT did-you-mean.
#
# Measured mechanism: `answer.py::not_found_error_message`'s
# `attachment_types_on_file` branch (line 3233-3252) sets `is_clarification =
# True` whenever the `predicate` carries `attachment_types_on_file` (an
# unrecognised attachment_type word) - REGARDLESS of whether the product token
# ALSO has real near-match candidates. `build_suggest_offer`'s own `is_clar`
# gate (`miss_suggest.py:394,414`, `if not is_clar and not require_spec:`) then
# SKIPS building `d1s` (the product did-you-mean candidates) entirely whenever
# `is_clarification` is True - so the two clarifications structurally cannot
# both reach the customer, and the attachment-type one wins outright by running
# first in `not_found_error_message`'s own if/elif chain.
#
# DIFFERENTIAL NOT ATTEMPTED: `answer.py`'s `not_found_error_message` /
# `build_suggest_offer` are called from exactly two production sites
# (`answer_bridge.py:691`, the bridge under test here, and
# `lanes/business/__init__.py:1892`, `complete_answer`'s own pre-rearch call) -
# but `git show origin/main:sorento_crm_backend/app/services/chatbot/lanes/
# business/answer.py | grep attachment_types_on_file` returns NOTHING: this
# entire branch does not exist on `origin/main`'s copy of the file at all, so it
# was added on THIS lane's own history (not inherited, not shared with a frozen
# main), and calling it a second time via `complete_answer` on this SAME branch
# would exercise the byte-identical function with the byte-identical
# `is_clar`/`d1s` interaction - it cannot show what "production" (main) does,
# only that this branch's OWN two callers agree with each other, which is not
# in question. Falling back to the UAC's own verbatim anchor (AC-1703) and the
# measured mechanism above, cited by file:line, for a coder to verify against
# the owner's actual paste.

# MEASURED (this session): it already does. GREEN CONTROL, not a red - see the
# assertion's own comment below for the fixture-double nuance (why the second
# section's own rendered TEXT does not literally say "incoming"). The pending
# genuinely keeps both domains and the bridge/compose path fetches both after

# Item 6 - AC-1703 (F8 "Incoming srtwt7202-new"). Live turn
# `5cde645f-7e01-489b-833c-fe41876daa9f` answers "I don't know 'new' as a
# product type." The brief's own premise is that "the parser split 'new' off as
# a product_type word" - MEASURED FALSE: the turn's own recorded `raw.derived`/
# `raw.parser_raw` (`chatbot.turns.trace`, `understood` stage) carries exactly
# ONE entity, `{"raw": "srtwt7202-new", "hint": "product", ...}` - no separate
# `product_type` entity at all. The parser already got this right.
#
# The split happens DOWNSTREAM, in `resolve_gate.py`'s `require`/`predicate_words`
# derivation (`resolve_gate.py:703-725`): `derive_require` (`predicate.py:180-181`,
# `_BARE_LEG_BY_INTENT["check_incoming"] -> {"incoming": True}`) fires
# UNCONDITIONALLY for every `check_incoming` turn, including a bare product-code
# lookup with no attribute/class-word ask at all - there is no gate on "does
# this turn actually describe a SET" before the predicate/described-set pipeline
# engages. `derive_predicate_words` (`predicate.py:232-235`) then adds the leg
# word itself ("incoming") to `predicate_words`, and the SERVER-SIDE described-
# set matcher (reached through the same `resolve_entity_body` the real resolver
# call posts, confirmed live via this turn's own `looked_up` envelope:
# `unrecognized_terms` ends up containing "new") treats the token's own trailing
# hyphen-suffix as a candidate class/type word once the leg has engaged - a
# genuine ENGINE-level defect, not a parser-prompt one, replaying the ALREADY-
# CORRECT recorded verdict below.
#
# This directly contradicts the brief's instruction to treat this item as "no
# engine red" - see the handoff for detail. Written and left RED, matching what
# was actually measured.

class TestIncomingHyphenSuffixNeverReadsAsAnUnknownProductType:
    """Reviewer MB-3 (re-check round, 20 Sep 2026): `resolve_gate._token_of`
    (`resolve_gate.py:587-602`) folds a token's hyphens ONLY when the entity's OWN
    `hint == "product"` - the resolver never reads it, the PARSER's hint word decides.
    The captain's live re-check saw the parser emit `inbound_shipment` for this exact
    ask on one of two runs (`Couldn't find: "srtwt7202-new" (inbound shipment)`), so
    `hint="product"` alone (this class's original, still-passing parametrization) does
    not guard AC-1703 for the shape live traffic actually produces. Re-parametrized
    over BOTH hints per the re-check brief; `allowed_lookup` is `['product',
    'inbound_shipment', 'category', 'brand']` in both (measured, reviewer), so the
    guard's own `allowed` filter is not what differs - only the token folding is."""
