"""S5 - the escalation lane (`branch_kind == out_of_scope`). AC-501 to AC-507.

RED, written before `app/services/chatbot/lanes/escalation.py` exists (Phase 2, test-first).
Everything below fails today with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
'app.services.chatbot.lanes'` (or, for the engine test, `AttributeError` from
`monkeypatch.setattr` naming an attribute `engine.py` does not have yet) - the right reason,
per the brief.

**Correction (5 Sep 2026, live captures + live node bodies).** The FIRST pass at this file
was ported from the `sub-escalation-live` EXPORT, which carries uncommitted edits from
another lane. The live workflow (`fr2u3e6FKg52cPvK` @ version `bac9613b`, 10 nodes,
confirmed by 66 fresh captures) is SIMPLER:

    escalation-input -> escalation-context -> clarify-company-gate (If)
        -> [true]  clarify-company-reply -> escalation-result {arm: clarify}
        -> [false] Call 'sub-human-intervention'  -> escalation-result {arm: human-intervention}

There is NO `fresh-entity-gate`, NO `clarify-team-gate` / `clarify-team-reply`, NO
`restore-item` on live - those are stale riders from an unpromoted build (B-TEAM-1' /
B-HB-1, still in the plan's hazard table as "port the fix S5", not yet promoted). Consequences
for this file, verified against the live node bodies (shas recorded in the scratchpad
`live-bodies/INDEX.txt` this correction was built from):

* `escalation-context.live.js`'s ladder has FIVE outcomes, no `gate` parameter anywhere:
  `picked_member` -> `company_pick` -> `sameTeam` (three sub-arms: `prior_state` /
  `prior_state_no_company` / `multi_company_unpicked`, the last from `routing_roster_plan`
  or `routing_companies` holding more than one row) -> `stated_brand` -> `none`. It computes
  `team = (o.routing || {}).suggested_team || null` with NO team default at this layer.
* `escalation-context` never calls a resolver: `resolve_and_gate` is a service the lane
  keeps in its seam for the day B-HB-1 promotes, but on live it is NEVER invoked (H26 stays
  open - noted, not fixed, by this slice).
* A null `routing.suggested_team` is not actually reachable through the real pipeline today:
  the ALREADY-PORTED parser (`head/output_exchange.py`'s `derive_routing` nullish chain)
  hard-defaults `suggested_team` to `"customer_service"` before escalation-context ever sees
  it ("Both chains end in a HARD default, which is why this body never emits a null team" -
  `output_exchange.py`'s own comment). That is the live mechanism the correction calls "the
  LIVE default applies" - it lives in the parser, not in this lane, and it is why H27
  (no hard default) stays open on live: nothing here asks a clarifying question, a team
  simply never arrives null in practice. Feeding the lane a null team directly (as the tests
  below still do, to test the LANE'S OWN behaviour at its input boundary) is therefore
  testing state the real pipeline does not produce today - which is exactly why the
  "would ask" tests are `xfail(strict=True)`, not deleted: B-TEAM-1' promoting adds
  `clarify-team-gate` for real, and `strict=True` makes that promotion NOTICEABLE (an
  unexpected pass fails the suite until the `xfail` marker is removed).
* `clarify-company-reply.live.js` has no `gate`/no-roster branch either - one clarify-text
  shape, not two.
* `escalation-result.live.js` checks `clarify-company-reply` only - no `clarify-team-reply`
  branch to fall through to.
* The assignment path (`live-sub-human-intervention@ae310ea1`, the same `test-guard` / `get-
  round-robin-assignee` / `if-conversation-unassigned` / `Assign or unassign a Conversation1`
  / `conversation-sla-tracking-create` / `Call 'sub-add-comment-respond'` /
  `sorento-sub-respond-sendmsg-respond-routed-to-pic{,2}` bodies) is IDENTICAL to what the
  first pass already encoded - it has no Code nodes to differ. `test_assignment_actions_in_order`
  and its siblings are unchanged. `test-guard` sits before `sorento-sub-respond-sendmsg-
  respond-routed-to-pic2` and everything after it, which is the H37 gate D14 reproduces:
  nothing side-effecting runs before the dry-run check.

Ported nodes, source read-only from
`sorento_crm_n8n/n8n-workflows-init/export/sub-escalation-live/` (topology only - the Code
node BODIES there are the stale export and are NOT used to derive expectations) and the
live bodies fetched separately: `escalation-input`, `escalation-context`, `clarify-company-
gate` (an `If`, no Code body), `clarify-company-reply`, `escalation-result`, and the
assignment path inside `sub-human-intervention`.

**This file PINS a contract the plan states only at the `run()` level. The exact function
names below are this tester's design decision, made explicit here so the coder implements
against them rather than guessing:**

    app/services/chatbot/lanes/escalation.py
        escalation_input(trigger) -> dict                     # port of escalation-input.js
        escalation_context(item, *, ctx) -> dict               # port of escalation-context.js (live)
        clarify_company_reply(item, *, ctx) -> dict            # port of clarify-company-reply.js (live)
        escalation_result(*, clarify_team=None, clarify_company=None) -> dict
                                                                # port of escalation-result.js;
                                                                # `clarify_team` is always None on
                                                                # live (kept for B-TEAM-1' promotion)
        run(ctx, item, *, services, dry_run=False) -> dict
            -> {"arm": "clarify" | "human-intervention", "clarify": dict | None,
                "actions": list[dict], "pending": dict | None}

    `services` is a duck-typed namespace (see `_services()` below) with four callables:
    `resolve_and_gate(ctx, item)`, `next_assignee(body)`, `sla_create(body)`, `team_members(...)`.
    On live, `run()` NEVER calls `resolve_and_gate` (no fresh-entity-gate to trigger it) and
    NEVER calls anything side-effecting when `dry_run` is True (H37: the dry-run check runs
    BEFORE any of them, never after - the live `test-guard` If is itself first).

    `app/services/chatbot/engine.py` imports `run` under the name `run_escalation_lane`
    (the same "import the function by name into engine's namespace so a test can monkeypatch
    `engine_mod.<name>`" pattern the file already uses for `check_access` / `default_space_id` /
    `post_process` / `suggest_follow_up`) and calls it when `branch_kind == "out_of_scope"`
    AND `"out_of_scope"` is in `system_settings.chatbot_completed_lanes` (contract addition,
    5 Sep 2026: a JSON list column, default `[]`). With the lane's name absent from that list
    (the default), the turn keeps pre-S5 behaviour - delegated to n8n, `run_escalation_lane`
    never called - even though `"out_of_scope"` is (or will be) in
    `contracts.CRM_COMPLETED_BRANCH_KINDS`; the branch-kind set says the CRM CAN finish the
    lane, the settings list says whether it currently DOES, per tenant. `system_settings_row`
    (`tests/chatbot/conftest.py`) is the seeding seam for all three engine tests below.

`pending` is a plain dict, not yet required to validate against `contracts.Pending`.

Nothing here reaches an LLM, n8n, respond.io, or a real MCP server.

    everything after it, which is exactly this ordering).

    Ruling (5 Sep 2026, AC-503/AC-507, AMENDED 6 Sep 2026): a dry run still RETURNS all four
    would-be actions, in order, with `dry_run: true` and PREVIEW placeholders in place of
    whatever only a WRITING seam could produce - the comment text carries the literal
    `<preview>` marker in place of the SLA timestamps (no `conversation-sla-tracking-create`
    row exists to read them from), and every action is flagged `preview: true`. This is what
    lets a dry-run turn's trace/preview UI show the customer AND the CRM exactly what would
    happen, not just that something would.

    The amendment (owner console pass, 6 Sep 2026): the ASSIGNEE is no longer a null
    placeholder. `preview_assignee` reads the same pool and the same cursor as the live draw
    and advances neither, so the preview names who the live turn WOULD pick. What this test
    pins is therefore no longer "nobody was named" but the thing that actually matters: the
    round-robin cursor did not move and no SLA row exists.

    Row counts on the real (blank) Postgres schema are the second net for H37 itself: even
    if the coder's `run()` bypassed the injected `services` and called a real production
    function directly, that would show up here as a nonzero count, where a call-count

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Owner console defect L (owner ruling: "LOOKUP"). Evidence: "escalate to Nurain"
# (customer service staff) and "escalate to marketing" both arrived with
# `_parser_raw.routing = {suggested_team: null, suggested_agent: null}`, and the engine
# INHERITED the previous turn's team (marketing_product / purchasing) instead - `add_comment`
# named the wrong team.
#
# D11: the parser already emits `person_mention` (`head/parser.py:130`, a required output
# key) - the escalation lane reads it here and resolves it against a staff roster seam
# (pinned below as `services.staff_lookup(name) -> list[dict]`; the coder may rename or
# fold it into the already-declared-but-unwired `team_members` seam in
# `escalation_services.py` if that is the better fit - see that module's own "declared and
# NOT wired" note). This lane test does NOT touch a real staff table; the seam is mocked,
# same discipline as `next_assignee` / `sla_create` throughout this file.
#
# NOTE for the coder: the parser prompt's team vocabulary may need "marketing" mapped to
# `marketing_product` for part (c)'s bare "escalate to marketing" phrasing to even reach
# this lane with a recognisable, if unmapped, team WORD - that prompt change is OUTSIDE
# this lane and outside this test file; this suite only pins what the LANE does once a
# `person_mention` or an explicit-but-unmapped ask reaches it with `routing` null.

# `_parser_raw` at all outside the person-mention arm - `_person_routing`'s "no team, no

# answer, exec 13633742's own fix for the person-mention arm). So a turn whose CURRENT
# team is only INHERITED from the stale pending offer (routing.suggested_team ==
# "warehouse", exactly as `output_exchange.py`'s nullish chain falls back to when the
# parser named nothing) reads as "team already known" and silently reassigns, rather

# Review of #706, blocker B1. The D1 clarify arm in `_person_routing` ("no person, no
# parser team, and a previous turn HAD one: ask") fired on EVERY acceptance from turn 2 on.
# `output_exchange` hard-defaults `routing.suggested_team` to `customer_service` and
# `compile_state` persists it every turn, so `prev_team` is always truthy, and the parser's
# own team is null whenever the customer did not name one - which is every bare "yes".
# Route sends `is_escalation_confirmation` straight into this lane and `run()` reaches
# `_person_routing` unconditionally, so AC-817 rule 3's "a bare yes still confirms" was
# true at the post-processor and false end to end. Measured through `run()` on base
# 89ab3773c versus #706's HEAD: all three cases below returned `clarify` on HEAD.
