"""H58 / AC-813: the chatbot's tool allow-list, pinned to the real MCP catalogue.

The chatbot picks one tool per turn by cosine similarity over the shared `mcp_tool`
embedding pool and calls the single top hit (`lanes/business/fetch.py::tool_filter`), so
any tool it can retrieve is a tool a customer's phrasing can cause to be CALLED. Six write
tools live in that pool: `crm_complaint_close`, `crm_order_cancel`,
`crm_purchase_request_approve`, `crm_purchase_request_reject`,
`crm_it_support_ticket_create` and `crm_ideation_turn`.

**They stay in the pool.** The in-app AI assistant retrieves from the same pool and
`record_action_bootstrap` puts the four record actions there deliberately so its Tool-RAG
can find them; it gates each behind a user confirmation (`_is_write_tool`) and a permission
check. Filtering the pool would have taken the assistant's write tools away from it. The
read-only rule belongs to the CHATBOT, which has no user to confirm with, and it is applied
on the chatbot's own retrieval and call seams.

**The allow-list is a frozen set in the backend, not a walk of the catalogue.** The
deployed backend image has no copy of `sorento_crm_mcp` (compose builds it with
`context: ./sorento_crm_backend`, `mcp` is not in `requirements.txt`, no volume mounts it),
so a catalogue read on the turn path would raise in every container and `run_fetch`'s broad
`except` would turn every live business turn into "MCP tool X failed".

This file is where the frozen set and the catalogue are held together. It imports the
catalogue, which IS available in CI and in a checkout, and asserts the set equals the
catalogue's own answer, so drift in either direction fails here rather than in production.
