"""Phase 2 RED tests - issue #1262 (Samantha case), slice 2, finding F1c.

Turns T4/T5/T7: the kind-pick label "Sorento (customer)" (never a real `uuid`) gets
copied into a `uuid` field or a `customer_ids` filter at every write/carry seam that
does not check the shape first. The fix is ONE `is_uuid` check re-used at every seam
(plan, slice 2 row): `turn_runtime._spec_row`, `turn_runtime.candidates_by_kind`,
`lanes/business/__init__._outstanding_filters_from`,
`lanes/business/fetch._outstanding_filters_from_ctx`, `turn/apply._settle_question_
subject`, `turn_runtime.outstanding_carry`, and the fetch tool args
(`fetch.entity_ids_transformer`).

AC-S2-1: none of these seams ever writes a non-UUID string into a `uuid` field or a
`customer_ids` filter; a real UUID alongside the label still survives.
AC-S2-2: a session already holding `customer_ids: ["Sorento (customer)"]` on its open
question has the label dropped at read, never reaching `crm_outstanding_report`'s
tool args.
AC-S2-3: partially expressible here - see the module docstring's own note at the
bottom of the file.

Plan: PLAN-chatbot-samantha-slices-26sep.md, slice 2. UAC:
chatbot-samantha-slices-26sep-acceptance-criteria.md.

Postgres-only per repo convention, though none of these seams touch the DB - they are
pure functions/dicts, so no fixture is seeded (nothing here is a DB row).

    uses (`_capturing_mcp`, direct `run_fetch` calls).

    T5's own shape: the ONLY customer subject riding on the turn is the kind-pick
    label "Sorento (customer)" (not a uuid), carried the way a session's open
    question carries it (`outstanding_carried_customer_ids`, `_settle_question_
    subject`'s own output). Case A - nothing else names a subject: the turn must NOT
    call `crm_outstanding_report` with no usable customer; it must ask which customer
    instead (no tool call at all). Case B - a real subject remains (a product code):
    the report still runs for it, and the unusable label never rides along as a
    `customer_ids` filter.

    Red today: `lanes/business/__init__.py`'s outstanding-report override picks the
    tool off `carried_subject` (truthy for ANY non-empty `outstanding_carried_
    customer_ids`, label included - `carried_subject = ... or bool(jsc.array(parse_
    output.get("outstanding_carried_customer_ids")))`) and never checks whether that
