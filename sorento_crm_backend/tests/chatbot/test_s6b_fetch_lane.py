"""RED tests for S6b - the business lane's fetch step (AC-604 to AC-606).

Written BEFORE `app/services/chatbot/lanes/business/fetch.py` exists (Phase 2, test-first).
Every test below is expected to fail today with an `ImportError` / `AttributeError` naming
that module or one of its functions - that is the correct red reason. A failure for any
other reason (a typo in a fixture path, a wrong assertion) is a defect in THIS file, not
evidence the port is done.

Scope: `sub-fetch-results` (tool pick -> tool-filter -> tier probe -> entity-ids-transformer
-> MCPRuntimeClient -> output-structurer -> fetch-result). S6a's resolve+gate (already merged
into this branch) is the caller; S6c's answer/miss lane is NOT built yet, so the "result" arm
of `fetch_result` only hands the fetch payload back to n8n via `delegate_payload` - it does not
render a customer-facing answer.

Hazards: H11 (zero tools must not silently produce an empty turn), H43 (moot - the in-process
call binds `domain` directly, there is no missing `$4`), H46 (`_isTimeline` is a CONTAINS
check, not an equality check - `contracts.is_timeline` is the one place this is decided and
S6b must consume it, not re-derive it), H49 (verify the live tool-selection distribution before porting
any per-tool branch - `crm_order_management_orders_by_product_list` was never selected in the
captures graded so far), H52 (the MCP call goes through the CONFIGURED url,
`settings.ai_assistant_mcp_url`, never a literal IP or scheme), H53 (there is no tool
search at all since 8 Sep 2026 - the tool is read off `contracts.DOMAIN_SPEC` - so this
package still issues no SQL and names no table).

**Contract this file assumes and asserts** (S6a set the precedent - see
`lanes/business/services.py`'s `ResolveGateServices` and its own `_probe()` docstring, which
names this exact seam as "S6b's fetch, over MCPRuntimeClient (D10)"):

    app.services.chatbot.lanes.business.fetch
        select_tool(domain: str | None) -> list[{"name": str, "similarity": float}]
            One candidate, `DOMAIN_SPEC[domain].tools[0]`, or none. `select_tool`'s own
            per-domain grading lives in `test_tool_pick_from_domain_spec.py`.
        tool_filter(candidates: list[dict], *, has_product: bool | None) -> ToolPick
            ToolPick.items  : the n8n item list, [] or [{"json": {...best, "_tool_pick": {...}}}]
                              - BYTE-EQUAL to today (D8 parity)
            ToolPick.outcome: "picked" | "not_found" - H11's fix, ALWAYS distinguishable
        tier_probe_plan(tier_gate: dict) -> list[dict]           (n8n item-list shape)
        tier_probe_collect(tier_gate: dict, *, plan_items, probe_results) -> dict
        entity_ids_transformer(trigger: dict) -> dict[str, Any]  (tool call args)
        call_tool(name: str, args: dict, *, mcp) -> Any           (thin pass-through, H52)
        output_structurer(result: dict, ctx: dict) -> dict        (deterministic, H7)
        fetch_result(item: dict, *, tool=None, tier_probe=None) -> dict  (adds `_fetch_arm`)

    app.services.chatbot.lanes.business.services
        FetchServices(mcp_call)  - dataclass, same shape as `ResolveGateServices`. It
        carried `embed` / `tool_search` until the tool RAG was dropped.

    app.services.chatbot.lanes.business (package init, alongside `run_until_exit`)
        run_fetch(payload, *, services: FetchServices, dry_run: bool) -> dict
            The next call site after `run_until_exit`'s "continue" exit: dispatches on
            `_fetch_arm` (see `TestEngineDispatch` below).

Where the plan/UAC under-specifies an exact function name, this docstring is the tester's own
choice, made explicit so the coder can push back on it rather than silently drifting from it.
