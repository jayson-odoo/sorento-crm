"""AC-921 / AC-922 through `run_turn`, not through `run_crossdomain` directly.

The console check of 7 Sep 2026 found Foundre's rule unreachable from a real turn while
every unit test of it was green, and the reason those tests could not see it is that they
all call `run_crossdomain` (or `crossdomain_render`) directly. This file drives the whole
turn - `engine.run_turn` against the Postgres blank-schema fixture, only the injectable
seams stubbed - so the question it answers is the owner's: "does a customer asking about a
product with no stock get told about the PO?"

The stock envelope is EMPTY on purpose (`has_result: false`, no items). That is the shape
the live turn produced for SRTWT7445-LV-NEW: the resolver found the product, the stock tool
answered with nothing, and the turn went to the miss half - which is where the cross-domain
block has to arrive.

**16 Sep 2026 rewrite** (AC-1592, "the crossdomain ladder climbs again, inside the turn
package", `bbc86cdd4`): the ladder moved from `lanes/business/answer.py::run_crossdomain`
(a dedicated probe seam, `AnswerServices.mcp_probe`) to `turn/fetch.py::_climb`, which walks
`chatbot_domains.ladder` and re-fetches each rung through the SAME `ctx.tool_runner` the
primary domain uses - `lanes/business.run_fetch` -> `output_structurer`. Two measured
consequences that make this file's OLD assertions the wrong shape now, not a bug in the
rewrite:

1. Every probe (primary AND rung) now answers with the RAW MCP presenter envelope
   (`result_type` / `items` / `has_result` / `restricted_fields`), not the pre-structured
   `answers` / `fields` shape `AnswerServices.mcp_probe` used to hand back directly -
   `_run_stock_turn`'s single `_mcp_call` builds that raw shape.
2. `turn/compose.py`'s generic section grammar (contract 102) has no PO-domain-specific
   sentence or field selection left (`lanes/business/answer.py::_crossdomain_rung_text`'s
   "Ordered"/"Outstanding" relabelling and dropped `po_number`/`company_name` fields is
   UNREACHED code now, still exercised only by the KEPT-node `test_crossdomain_ladder.py`
   corpus) - a rung renders as its own numbered section, in the tool's own field labels,
   under the primary's own miss line. It also only offers to escalate when EVERY domain on
   the turn missed (contract 127, "team pick for missed domains") - a rung that answers
   is not a miss, so no offer follows it (measured, see
   `TestAC921ThePORungReachesTheCustomer.test_a_stock_miss_with_an_open_po_says_so`).

One test (`TestOwner8SepTheRungIsPerContactAndOffersOnce.test_without_the_grant_no_probe_
and_the_ladder_off_note`) stays a confirmed RED: `_climb` probes every rung unconditionally
and does not carry over the OLD `_CROSSDOMAIN_RUNG_GRANT` per-contact gate
(`purchase_orders.placed`) - flag for a coder pass, do not silently retire it.

**AC-1706 re-pin (hand pass 9 round, 21 Sep 2026).** The owner-ruled "answer half
re-attach" plan (`documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-chatbot-answer-half-reattach.md`,
`chatbot-answer-half-reattach-acceptance-criteria.md`) reattached the OLD n8n-ported
composer - `answer_bridge.py`'s own miss breakdown (`not_found_error_message`) plus
`lanes/business/answer.py::run_crossdomain`/`_apply_crossdomain_rung`, reached through
`answer_bridge._fold_crossdomain_ladder` (`engine.py:1918`'s
`production_answer_services(db)`) - superseding the "16 Sep 2026 rewrite" section above:
`turn/fetch.py::_climb` is no longer what answers a business turn's cross-domain ladder.
Ten tests below pinned that now-superseded `_climb` wording; each is re-pinned to the
CURRENT production shape, measured directly through `engine.run_turn` (not guessed, not
re-derived from `crossdomain_render` in isolation):

    Here's what you want:
    • product: {code}

    But no {domain} matched these.
    {ladder sentence - "no PO placed" -> "but PO is placed:" + `_crossdomain_rung_text`'s
    own field lines, OR the three-way "nothing on order" sentence when the PO rung also
    finds nothing}

    Would you like me to escalate to warehouse team?

The escalate offer follows EVERY miss now, including one a rung partially answered -
`not_found_error_message`'s own offer is unconditional on a miss existing at all; it does
not read whether a LATER ladder rung filled in more text under it.

**Re-pinned again after the ladder-before-miss sequencing fix (coder 36, 21 Sep 2026),
then RETIRED by owner ruling 22 Sep 2026, R6 (AC-EQ-5).** The paragraph this replaces said
the PO rung stamps `parser["routing"]["suggested_team"]` to "purchasing" whenever it runs,
regardless of whether it found rows, so the offer named the rung's own team rather than
the stock team. `_CROSSDOMAIN_RUNG_TEAM` and that stamp are deleted: a stock-origin ask
is now ALWAYS suggested to the warehouse team, whichever rung answers it (AC-921,
`TestOwner8Sep`, AC-922) - measured directly through `engine.run_turn`, not assumed. Only
ONE offer reaches `result.reply.text` (the "said twice" defect
`TestOwner8SepTheRungIsPerContactAndOffersOnce`'s own docstring names stays fixed);
`_run_stock_turn`'s own `said` variable joins the reply text with a `send_message` action
that mirrors it verbatim, which is why a raw substring count against `said` would read 2 -
the count assertions below read `result.reply.text` alone. D7's incoming-origin climb is
UNCHANGED (AC-EQ-9): an incoming-origin ask that climbs to the PO rung still names
"purchasing", because that is the team `crossdomain_zeroset` set before the rung ever ran.

The rung's own field composer (`_crossdomain_rung_text`) never renders a PO Number line at
all (no per-document heading, owner ruling 11 Sep 2026, second ruling) - the OLD
`TestOwner8Sep` FLAG about `po_number` reaching the customer no longer applies to the
CURRENT composer, only to the now-fully-unreached `_crossdomain_rung_text`'s ancestor.

Behaviour pins that are UNCHANGED and must stay: the PO rung genuinely runs per contact
(`PO_TOOL in probes`, gated on `purchase_orders.placed`), it runs once per suffixed code
(AC-1690-adjacent, `TestTheSuffixedCodeShapeReachesTheRung`), the supplier field never
reaches the reply (`test_the_supplier_is_never_in_the_rung_text`, already green,
untouched), and D7's incoming-origin climb still reaches the PO rung
(`TestD7AnIncomingAskReachesThePORung`).

class TestIssue736SeparatorInsensitiveRequestedSet:
    """The one line that had Foundre's rule off for most of the catalogue (#736).

    `crossdomain_zeroset` builds its `requested` set by testing each resolved match's
    `canonical_code` for membership in the RESOLVER's token set. The resolver strips dashes
    and spaces from a product token before resolving it, so "SRTWT7445-LV-NEW" arrives as
    the token `SRTWT7445LVNEW` while the match it resolved to carries the hyphenated
    `canonical_code`. That test used `_norm_code` (strip + upper) on both sides, so it
    could never be true for a code with a separator: `requested` empty, `missing` empty,
    `active` False, `run_crossdomain` returning before it probed anything.

    Measured on two live turns whose traces are otherwise identical field for field
    (console-check-1788789839): `CB2904` - whose token and canonical code are the same
    string - got both rungs; `SRTWT7445-LV-NEW` got no cross-domain event at all.

    This class drives the ZEROSET with the resolver shape those live turns actually
    carried (an `intersection`, no `resolutions`, the token separator-stripped), which is
    the shape the rest of the file's stubs do not produce - and is therefore the shape that
