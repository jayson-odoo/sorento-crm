"""Issue #750: the `product_attachment` stamps ("- has Product Photos" / "- no Product
Photos") never render, on any of the three did-you-mean surfaces.

Plan: `documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-product-attachment-picker-stamp.md`.
UAC: `documentation/plans/chatbot/product-attachment-picker-stamp-acceptance-criteria.md`.

Owner console turn "photo for srtwc286" (local repro `chatbot.turns`
`bfe8e386-db90-46df-ae6b-35c15d636362`, 8 Sep 2026, `is_test`, contact 437264483) replied

    product_attachment search needs to be more specific. Multiple matches found. Please choose:
    1. SRTWC286-SH-200
    ...
    10. SRTWC286-SH

with no per-line stamp, so picking 1 dead-ends on "no Product Photos matched these" while
picking 4 (SRTWC286-SH) returns the file. The incoming and customer pickers carry the stamp;
this one does not.

**ROOT CAUSE, measured in process against the 7 Sep prod copy (`sorento_ai_automation_0907`),
read-only, with the contact's own company scope stamped on the session
(`engine._scoped_factory`'s own rule).** Nothing upstream of the render skips: the gate is
`require_specific` with 10 uuid-carrying options, `dym_transform` plans `probe_lane: "picker"`
with `probe_needed: True` and `probe_skip_reason: None`, the real probe answers with the
SRTWC286-SH row, and `dym_annotate` returns `ok: True`, `key_mode: "uuid"`,
`dym_available_codes: ["0d0ed752-fd6f-4759-ad8f-0b40e0cbc601"]`. The break is at the render:
`build_suggest_offer` keys each line back by product CODE while the annotator keyed the probe
by product UUID for this domain (`miss_suggest._annotate` sources `meta["probed"]` from
`dym_candidate_uuids` whenever `probe_uuid_keyed` is true, and `_dym_plan` sets that flag for
`product_attachment` on the `d1` and `picker` lanes), so 10 of 10 lines take the
"unprobed renders BARE" branch. `probe_uuid_keyed` and the picker surface landed in the SAME
commit (981860f7e, #674), an ancestor of prod, so the surface has never once stamped for this
domain, anywhere. Second defect behind the first: `DOMAIN_PROBE["product_attachment"].noun` is
`None`, so the render falls back to `attachment_noun()`, the customer's own raw token, and even
a key-mode fix alone would read "- has photo".

**How these tests run.** Every chain is seeded fresh on the blank Postgres schema
(`tests/chatbot/conftest.py::session_factory`), so CI's empty database is enough, and the REAL
resolver, gate, `dym_transform`, `dym_annotate`, `run_miss_lane` and `build_suggest_offer` are
driven: only `MCPRuntimeClient.call_tool` is monkeypatched, and it answers from the SEEDED rows
narrowed by the `product_ids` / `attachment_type_ids` the real `entity_ids_transformer` built,
in the envelope shape the real MCP answered this turn with (measured 8 Sep 2026:
`result_type: product_attachments`, `items[].fields` labelled "Company" / "Product Code" /
"Attachment Type" / "File Name"). No LLM, no network, no n8n: `spec_fallback` and
`understand_phrase` are forced off on the resolver call
(`test_engine_company_scope._real_resolve_entity`).

The has / no split asserted here was verified with SQL against the prod copy first
(`SRTWC286-SH` carries `SRTWC286-SH.jpg` and `SRTWC286_SH_2.jpg` of type Product Photos;
`SRTWC286-SH-200` carries only Certification and Technical Specifications), and each seed
reproduces exactly that split.

AC-3's resolver payload is a LITERAL rather than a real resolve, and that is forced: the D1
surface only fires when the token produced NO `matches` and the resolver's trigram
`alternatives` instead (`entity_resolver.TokenResolution.alternatives`), and the blank schema's
`search_path` excludes `public`, where `pg_trgm` lives, so `similarity()` cannot resolve and no
fuzzy neighbour can be produced here. The payload is built FROM the seeded rows (real uuids,
real codes) and handed to the REAL gate, which classifies it exactly as it classifies a
production one.
