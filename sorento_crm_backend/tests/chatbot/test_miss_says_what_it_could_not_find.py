"""ROGUE-CONVO-REVIEW PR-2: a miss says what it could not find (classes B, C, G).

Owner, 6 Oct 2026, one dealer conversation (availability-only contact). Each class is a
general rule; the 6 Oct turns are only its red tests. Plan:
`documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-rogue-convo-review-06oct.md`, UAC alongside.

* B (owner ruling Q3): a bare number typed as a product ("8066 stock ?") matches its code
  family exactly the way compact mode does, through the resolver's OWN substring probe
  (`entity_resolver._prefix_probe_product`), and offers the same which-one picker. On the
  availability path `engine._exact_codes_only` discarded those rows because the token
  is not `code_like` (letters AND digits), and the dealer read the scope sentence ("That
  would search every stock we have ...") for a product they had named.
* C (owner ruling Q4): "Here's what you want" lists only what the customer named and the
  resolver placed. A miss on the customer's own product token never lists spec_search
  SET MEMBERS under that header ("product: SRTWC200-S-UF-RL (+34 more)" over an unplaced
  description line), and never carries a `set_page`.
* G: an attachment with no `description` hands media intake `caption=None`, never the
  literal string "null" (`jsc.js_string(None)`), so the parser never reads a "null"
  line above the codes.

Fake fixture codes throughout.

# =========================================================================== R2: one fold
# ROGUE-CONVO-REVIEW-R2 (crew review on PR #1506): "did this message's own product token
# miss?" is one question with one fold. The resolver lists a product token with its
# separators dropped and its unicode dashes folded first (`resolve_gate._token_of`,
# `_UNICODE_DASH_FOLD` then `_PRODUCT_FOLD`); the engine keys its unplaced map and the
# composer joins its "what you want" header through the same key (`turn.state.token_key`).
# A code pasted with an EN DASH (Word autocorrect) or a MINUS SIGN (Excel paste) must fold
# the same on all three sides, or rule C silently never fires and the old "(+34 more)"
# header comes back. Input -> reply pins through the real engine, never a payload shape.

#: The hyphen, then every dash the resolver folds to one ahead of its regex
#: (`resolve_gate._UNICODE_DASH_FOLD`: what Word and Excel put where the dealer typed a
#: hyphen). Read off the resolver's own table, so a dash added there is pinned here too.
