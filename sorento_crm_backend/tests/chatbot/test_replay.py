"""Node replay: every ported node against the captured n8n executions (AC-004, AC-005).

This is the whole reason the port is worth doing. Each fixture is a real turn that ran
in production or on the fail-closed clone; the Python port is fed the SAME upstream
values and its output must equal what n8n recorded, byte for byte after a JSON round
trip. A disagreement fails unless `divergences.py` registers it with a hazard id.

Two parametrisations per node: the vendored subset (always) and the full corpus (skips
with a message when the sibling n8n checkout is absent). Nothing here touches a database,
the network, or an LLM - these are pure functions over captured JSON.

**Only a real capture grades the port.** `source.expected_from == "runData"` means the
`expected` block is what the node actually emitted in a real execution; `"reasoned"` means
somebody wrote it by hand, and the escalation-routing lane hand-revised 31 `reasoned`
`output_exchange` fixtures - same filenames - to encode the UNPROMOTED B-TEAM-1' behaviour.
Grading against those would make an unpromoted lane change a merge gate for this port. So
`runData` fixtures fail the suite on a mismatch and `reasoned` ones are replayed, counted
and reported by `test_reasoned_fixture_agreement_is_reported` without ever failing. See
`_corpus.py`'s docstring for the measured split.
