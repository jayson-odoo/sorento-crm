"""S6 cluster 4 owner ruling (16 Sep 2026, UAC "S6 rulings" block):

"An open question is answered only when the PARSER says so. `answers_open_question`
`{resolved, picks, answer}` becomes a declared parser schema key (it was read by APPLY
but never produced: the parser only emits `reference_positions`). APPLY: `resolved:
true` = apply the picks; `resolved: false` with an attempt = re-print the same
question; absent/null = the message is not an answer, run it for what it is and CARRY
the pending unchanged (sticky, never repeated). Owner: 'follow the old bot, it is
smarter, no hard coding, LLM aware'."

Three reds:

1. `head/parser.py::PARSE_OUTPUT_JSON_SCHEMA` does not declare `answers_open_question`
   at all today (measured: absent from both `properties` and `required`) - the parser
   is never actually asked to emit it, so `turn/apply.py`'s read of it
   (`verdict.get("answers_open_question")`) can only ever see the harness's own
   hand-built default.
2. The fallback `SEMANTIC_PARSER_PROMPT` does not document the key either (measured:
   the literal string is absent) - an LLM parsing against the live prompt has no
   instruction to ever emit it.
3. `turn/apply.py::_answer_pending` cannot currently tell an EXPLICIT "that did not
   answer it" (`resolved: false`) from "this message was never an attempt at all"
   (`answers_open_question` absent/null): both fall through to the same unconditional
   re-print (`answer_pending_unresolved`, `tests/chatbot/test_rearch_s2_number_answers.py
   ::test_a_position_out_of_range_leaves_state_unchanged_and_reprints` pins the FIRST of
   these and is left untouched). The absent/null case must instead run the message for
   what it is (no short-circuit) and carry the pending forward unresolved.
