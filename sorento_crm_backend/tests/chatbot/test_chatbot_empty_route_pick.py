"""CHATBOT-EMPTY-ROUTE-PICK (owner repro, 30 Sep 2026, Chatbot Console, contact Fanny Ng,
parser v37): "Zhin heng delivered on 23/9" inside an open DO list answered with

    Customer: Zhin heng / Product: all products / Dates: 23/09/2026

    Please choose who to route to (reply with the number):

    If you have no preference, just reply 'yes' and we'll assign automatically.
    No orders matched these.

and the parser emitted `open_question_answer {"mode": "pick", "items": [], "picked": [1]}`
although no question was open (the previous bot turn was the list, a data answer).

Two defects, one file:

* `order_list.list_reply` (R6, "inside an order list no escalate offer and no routing
  picker") took the picker's numbered rows out of the text but left the picker's header
  and its "reply 'yes'" close standing over nothing, and `_one_line_miss` dropped the
  "But no order matched these. Would you like me to escalate ..." line (the offer
  sentence rides on it), which is the blank line under the header.
* Nothing dropped the parser's declared answer to a question that was never asked: the
  `Open question:` line is built by `turn/question.open_question(pending, tasks)` off
  `State.pending` and the stock task, and when that is None every reader must see the
  null answer and no positions - a hallucinated pick must never influence the turn.

Owner ruling 4 Oct 2026 (PICKER-ESCALATION): "any no answer should get the escalation
question, that's the gist". An empty list inside an open list is a no-answer, so R6 no
longer touches it: the escalate offer and its routing picker stay, whole, as on a first
ask. R6 still takes the picker out of a list that answered, and nothing of its frame may
stay there either.
