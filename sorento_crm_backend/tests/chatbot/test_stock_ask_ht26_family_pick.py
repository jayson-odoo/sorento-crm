"""Owner hand test 26 Sep 2026 (PR #1247), slice 2: a family becomes a which-one pick,
and an exact code wins.

Owner ruling 26 Sep (R1 re-ruled, "for R1 - okay can"): #1118's quantity collection is
changed in this PR. Every test below is one owner turn from the scout's comment, with the
focus state quoted there as its fixture:

* T1 "check stock srtwc286": ten SRTWC286-SH* products, none coded SRTWC286. Was a
  ten-slot quantity task; is a pick with no task.
* T2 "88" under that question: was a re-ask of all ten; is the pick again, carrying 88.
* T3 "check stock srtwc286 88 pcs": the 88 joined to nothing; rides on the pick, and the
  code the dealer then types is answered with it.
* T4 "check stock SRTWC286-SH": an exact code among its nine siblings keeps only itself.
* T5 fresh "check stock SRTWC286-SH-UF": one product, one named question.
* T6 "10" after that question: answered.

Drives the same seams `engine.py` does, in the same order: `turn/task.py::after_reply`
(what the stock tool's reply leaves), `engine._stock_ask_reply` (what the turn then says
and stores) and `turn/apply.py::apply` (what the answering turn fetches).
