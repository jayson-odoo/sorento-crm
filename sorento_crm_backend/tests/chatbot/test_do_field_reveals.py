"""DO-ASK-SIMPLIFY rule 2: five DO fields are per-contact field reveals, hidden by default.

`documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-do-ask-simplify-2oct.md`, rule 2. Status, Pickup Time,
Transporter, Driver and Lorry Plate on a delivery order list carry a `contact_field_reveals`
key under `delivery_orders.*`; a contact without the grant never reads them. Every other DO
field (Order Number, Customer, dates, Products, Company, Warehouse) is always shown.

The real MCP presenter renders the row, then the chatbot's `output_structurer` gates it, so
this pins the whole chain the WhatsApp reply goes through.
