"""Hand pass 12 RED tests, batch 4 (tester 53) - the parser-hint-mismatch rerun
variant, HIT header ledger names, the pick-path zero-stock ladder, and a unit pin for
coder 44's already-landed MFG6661 fix (M2, `359b5327c`). No implementation exists yet
for the first three; the fourth documents a landed fix that had no pytest artifact.

Harness conventions, all copied rather than invented:

* `TestC1VariantParserHintMismatchResolvedKindWins` and
  `TestPickPathZeroStockLadderClimbsAfterADidYouMeanPick` use `test_rearch_r5_
  production_decides.py::_mcp_double`/`_seed_contact_and_get` + `test_rearch_r6_
  review_round.py::_run_turn_engine`/`_capturing_probe` - the REAL resolver/gate/
  narrower over seeded Postgres rows, `FetchServices.mcp_call` / `AnswerServices.
  mcp_probe` the only doubles, the SAME convention every hand pass 12 file already
  uses. `test_rearch_r12_handpass12.py`'s own `_seed_state`/`_focus`/`_state_of`/
  `_said`/`_unknown_envelope` are imported directly, and `test_rearch_r12_
  handpass12_b.py`'s own `_seed_shipment` is duplicated locally (three lines, not
  worth a cross-file import into a file that does not otherwise depend on `_b.py`).
* `TestM2MFG6661ScopeExactTokenRefusesThePrefixSweep` is a direct unit test of
  `crossdomain_zeroset`, the SAME level `test_crossdomain_ladder.py::
  TestOwner12SepTypedPrefixIsRequested` already pins the sibling "prefix but not
  exact" rule at - no engine, no DB, no resolver; the fix (`_token_requests` gaining
  `all_norm_codes`) lives entirely inside this one pure function.
* `TestGroupFHitHeaderNamesLedgers` reuses `test_rearch_r12_handpass12.py::
  TestGroupFCustomerPickHeaderNamesEveryLedgerNotACode`'s own seeding shape (a
  `customer_pick` pending, ledger rows seeded as real `Customer` rows) but over a
  HIT reply (real order rows returned) rather than that class's own MISS - a
  meaningfully different render path (`lanes/business/__init__.py`'s own scope-block
  builder, ~line 290, read on a HIT).

Postgres only (`session_factory`, blank schema). Every row seeded fresh per test; no
row is borrowed from another test or from any live/clone data.

        mishint, decides whether the typed entity COMBINES with or REPLACES the
        carried one, and a resolved `inbound_shipment` combines against a carried
        `product` (a different kind) exactly as C1's own correctly-hinted turn
        does. The combined call misses live (`envelope.has_result: false`) and the
        live bot never reruns - it answers "Here's what you want: ... But no
        incoming matched these. Would you like me to escalate?" - because `app/

        `current_kind_entities` gate reads the PARSER's hint
        (`e.get("hint") == record_kind`) to decide whether this turn even
        qualifies as record-key-typed, and the parser hinted "product", not
        "inbound_shipment" - so the gate never fires and the miss stands, no
        rerun at all, even though the SAME function's `keep`/`drop` split two
        lines down already reads the RESOLVED `entity_type` correctly. Owner
        ruling 5 (hand pass 12): rerun once on a REFINE miss when the entity typed
