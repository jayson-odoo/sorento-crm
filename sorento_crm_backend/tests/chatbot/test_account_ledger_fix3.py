"""RED tests for review round 3 (ACCOUNT-LEDGER): two AND customer words, and an enforced
contact's own ledger dropped as an exact-name "sibling".

`documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-account-ledger-2oct.md` Design 6 and 8.

* N-a: the AND answer carries no per-token rows, so two customer words that each carry an
  account share ONE stand-in resolution. Narrowing it for the first word, then refusing the
  second off what was left, is wrong ("SOON HENG TRADING has no Account 3. It has Account 1.").
  With more than one word in the AND shape, the rows are narrowed once by the SET of asked
  levels and nothing is refused.
* Security nit: the exact trading name rule ("a word that IS one trading name speaks for that
  name alone") must not drop an ENFORCED contact's own linked ledger. A linked contact whose
  link is "ABC TRADING ENTERPRISE [A/C I]" types "abc trading acc 1" under a non-order domain:
  the scope gate passes (the word is in its link's name), the resolver also answers a foreign
  "ABC TRADING [A/C I]", and the exact rule used to drop the contact's own ledger as a sibling,
  leaving only the foreign row, which the scope screen then refused.
