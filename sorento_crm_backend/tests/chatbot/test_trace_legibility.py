"""AC-007: every trace record is plain language, for every `branch_kind`.

`test_engine.py::TestHappyPath.test_the_trace_is_sentences_not_json` proves this for the
one branch kind its happy path exercises (`business_query`). This file drives `run_turn`
through the remaining declared kinds - the AC's own wording is "any stage of a turn", not
"the common one" - and adds the "is a sentence" property `test_engine.py` did not check: a
summary or `why` a machine assembled by string-joining without a separator is not a
sentence even though it contains no `{`/`[`, so every record here must also contain a
space.

Retired 16 Sep 2026 (AC-1592, coordinator ruling - the S3/S6 rearch changed what these
`branch_kind`s mean or how they are reached, so the OLD scenario setup here no longer
exercises the branch it claims to):

- `test_escalate_offer`, `test_out_of_scope` - both routed through the now-retired
  `output_exchange` module (AC-1594). Since the S3 rearch, `branch_kind == "out_of_scope"`
  is reached via the escalation-arm team-pick offer (contract 106/108) whose acknowledgement
  lives in `send_message`/`add_comment` actions, never `reply["text"]` - replacement
  coverage (including trace-record shape) is `test_rearch_s3_team_pick_and_866.py`
  (`TestPort866AsRunTurnCases`).
- `test_offer_hold` - asserted the legacy flat `session_vars["selection_context"]` /
  `routing_roster_plan"]` keys (AC-1504/1521 nested-shape retirement); the S6/S0 rearch
  moved this state under `session_vars["variables"]["focus"]`. No standalone
  trace-legibility replacement was named for `offer_hold` specifically - flagged, not
  ported, per the coordinator's instruction to retire per the verdict list as given.
- `test_stock_denied`, `test_demand_qty` - the S6 ruling replaced the direct
  `custom_fields[].name == "is_allowed_stock"` injection this file used with the real
  stock-visibility gate; replacement coverage is `test_rearch_s6_stock_allowed.py`.

`test_ideate` is NOT retired - its failure was an ENV gap (the autouse MCP-`call_tool`
guard in `conftest.py` forbids an unstubbed `crm_ideation_turn` call), fixed below by
stubbing `ideate_mod.call_ideation_tool` the same way `test_s3_canned_and_ideate.py`'s
`test_ideate_branch_calls_mcp_tool` does.

Nothing here reaches an LLM, n8n, respond.io or the MCP server - same seam as
`test_engine.py`.
