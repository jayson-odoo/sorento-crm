"""Owner console pass 4, item 2 (7 Sep 2026): "last month" after a resolved customer pick
loses the customer scope on the actual tool call, though the header still names it right.

Production turns 5bb0426e-df3b-4765-bb2b-48b6bf44e20c ("3" -> L.A.W. Transport) then
cc0075ae-ac49-4fbb-a7bf-9adb9b564280 / 0d9332a0-8115-4747-af5b-e7568fca4f05 ("last month",
`turns-lane3` + round 12 `LAW-t3`). Both "last month" captures: `selection_context:
disambiguation` is STILL carried from the earlier picker turn, `_pending_pick: true`,
`ctx.parse.output.entities` correctly carries the picked customer with its real uuid
(`bec07281-8c52-4581-af8a-ad2d7a5f8e16`, canonical_code `301-C001`) and
`date_filter_start`/`date_filter_end` (round 12's capture keeps them; the earlier one nulled
them, registered as a separate, already-resolved divergence). The reply HEADER is built from
`qf.entities` and is right ("Customer: L. A. W. Transport (K.L.) Sdn. Bhd. (SRT)" / "Dates:
01/08/2026 to 31/08/2026"), but the ROWS are for a completely different customer (SILK
CABINETS SDN BHD) - the actual order-tool call never carried a customer filter at all.

`resolve_entity_body` (`app/services/chatbot/lanes/business/resolve_gate.py` ~:296-347) omits
`entity_pins` whenever `match_mode == "and"` (the route's own 400 rule) - which is this
turn's `match_mode` - so a CARRIED entity that already has a resolved `uuid` from a prior
turn is sent back to the resolver as a bare text token
(`"L. A. W. Transport (K.L.) Sdn. Bhd. (SRT)"`) with no pin, and whatever that free-text
search comes back with (or fails to) is what reaches `gate.compatible_entities` and, from
there, `entity_ids_transformer`'s `customer_ids`. This test seeds the SAME customer under
its real name and measures what the resolver, the gate and the tool call actually do with it
end to end - the production seam (LESSONS-LEARNT #102), not a hand-built `compatible_entities`
that would beg the question.

MEASURED against the LOCAL prod-copy database (7 Sep 2026, throwaway harness: the dump's own
`request_item` fed to `run_turn` with its `_parser_raw` as the parse and the MCP call
captured). The cause is NOT what the first pass guessed, and both halves of the guess are
recorded here so nobody re-runs them:

* **the date window is NOT dropped.** `2026-08-01` / `2026-08-31` survive the parser
  post-processor, `ctx.parse.output` and `resolve_gate`'s `semantic_input`. The production
  header states them, and every wrong row returned IS inside the window;
* **the resolver does not mis-rank anything, and `REQUIRE_SPECIFIC_DOMAINS` is not
  involved.** `gate_passed: true`, `require_specific: false`, `gate_reason: "ok"`,
  `unresolved_tokens: []`, full token coverage.

What actually happens: `resolve_entity_body` sends `tokens: ["301-C001"]` - the carried
entity's `canonical_code` - and OMITS `entity_pins`, because the resolver route refuses a
pin in AND mode by design (`app/api/v1/system/references.py` ~:1652, "AND-mode intersection
has no per-token view to narrow"; PR #456's contract is OR-mode only). So the ONE thing that
identifies the row the customer picked - `uuid bec07281-8c52-4581-af8a-ad2d7a5f8e16` - is
thrown away, and a debtor code that **99 rows share in the production database** is
re-resolved from scratch. The resolver returns 15 of those 99 (its own `limit`), the picked
row is not among them, and the gate then PASSES the lot: `cust_pinned` is true (the entity
is carried and carries a uuid), which suppresses the "which company do you mean" ask - so
the pin stops the QUESTION without constraining the ANSWER. The header renders `entity.raw`
(right) while the rows are 15 other customers' orders (wrong).

**Fixed at the gate, not at the resolver (issue #715, closed 7 Sep 2026, H77/AC-825).**
AND-mode `entity_pins` stays refused, exactly as PR #456 shipped it
(`references.py:1650-1655`) - the two reasons that refusal was authored for (an
intersection has no per-token view to narrow, and a zero-intersection AND request
retries under `force_mode="or"` where a pin would suddenly start applying) are still
true, and `resolve_entity_body` is unchanged. `gate.py`'s own "A PINNED PICK WINS OVER
FUZZY RE-RESOLUTION" mechanism already re-seated a carried pick's uuid (exec
13705266's fix widened its ENTRY gate to carried pins, `pin_uuids_all`) but never
widened its FILTER: `pin_types` / `pin_bases` / `pin_codes` and `_keep`'s own uuid
check stayed built from `pins` / `pin_uuids` (this-turn only), so a carried pick with
no current-turn pin left `pin_types` empty and `_keep` kept every resolver row
"untouched" - the pin stopped the QUESTION without constraining the ANSWER, which is
this test's own account above. Widened those four reads to `pins_all` /
`pin_uuids_all`, the same set the entry gate already used - the resolver's own wrong
rows for the shared debtor code are then REPLACED by the picked uuid, never merged
with it. See `TestACarriedCustomerPickIsPinnedAtTheGateNotAtTheResolver`.

    The mechanism already existed for a CURRENT-turn pick (`pins`, `current_message is

    fix, gated at `len(pin_uuids_all) > 0`) - it re-seated the picked uuid so the

    in pin_types: return True`) kept every resolver row "untouched" - the pin stopped
    the QUESTION ("which company do you mean?") without constraining the ANSWER. Fixed
    by widening those four reads to `pins_all` / `pin_uuids_all`, the same set the
    entry gate already uses.

    Exercises `run_gate` directly rather than the resolver seam, matching the fix's
    OWN layer: the resolver's bare re-search of `301-C001` is exactly what production
    measured (99 rows share the code, the resolver returns up to its own limit of
