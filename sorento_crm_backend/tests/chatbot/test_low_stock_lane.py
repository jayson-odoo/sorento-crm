"""S6 RED tests - the chatbot lane consuming the low stock report (#892).

`documentation/plans/scm/PLAN-low-stock-report.md` section S6;
`low-stock-report-acceptance-criteria.md` AC-62 to AC-66.

Mirrors `tests/chatbot/test_outstanding_lane.py`'s own classes wherever there is an
equivalent - `TestSoKeyListedInFieldRevealKeysAndCatalog`, `TestDateParams`, `TestToolPick`,
`TestFieldRevealGateBeforeFetch` - and reuses that file's helpers rather than inventing new
ones, so the two lanes are wired the same way and a reader who knows one knows the other.

Two ways a test here is red, both legitimate:

1. A literal/table assertion against code that already exists (`DOMAIN_SPEC["inventory"]`,
   `fetch.DATE_PARAMS`, `FIELD_REVEAL_KEYS`, `CHATBOT_TOOL_DOMAINS`) - red because the row
   is simply absent.
2. A behavioural assertion through `lanes.business.run_fetch`, the real call site the
   engine's fetch step uses. Red because `select_tool` returns the inventory domain's
   first-listed tool (`crm_inventory_stock_balance_list`) for every inventory ask, and
   there is no `low_stock_report` intent for it to override on.

**Deliberately NOT here:** full-turn composition tests. The low stock reply is one or two
lines the presenter already renders (AC-61, pinned in the MCP suite), so a turn-level test
would re-pin the same string through five more seams. The lane's own job - pick the tool,
gate it, shape the args, pass the attachments through - is what this file asserts.
