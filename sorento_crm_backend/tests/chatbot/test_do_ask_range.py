"""DO-ASK-SIMPLIFY rules 3 and 4: a dealer's DO list ask carries a range of at most 31 days.

`documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-do-ask-simplify-2oct.md`. Owner, 2 Oct 2026:

* Q1 (a): the cap is 31 days, inclusive, rolling (not "same calendar month").
* Q2 (b): dealers only. A dealer is a contact linked to a customer and holding no office
  access type (`contact_customer_scope(...).enforced`), behind ONE helper
  (`do_ask.is_dealer`) the ACCESS-MODEL lane later swaps for the Dealer role.
* Q3 (a): a quantity ask on the same tools is exempt.
* Naming one or more DO/SO/order numbers needs no range.

No range: nothing is fetched and the bot asks which period, with suggestions. Too long:
nothing is fetched and the bot says so, with suggestions. Driven through `run_fetch`, the
lane seam, with a stub MCP that records every call. Today is pinned to Fri 2 Oct 2026.
