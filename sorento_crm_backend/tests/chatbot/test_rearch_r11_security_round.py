"""Security review of the hand pass 11 delta, PR #952
(`/Users/tehjayson/Documents/foundryx/sorento_crm/.claude/handoffs/rearch-phase3-security-hp11.md`)
plus the reviewer's own S1/S2 (`.claude/handoffs/rearch-phase3-reviewer-hp11.md`). RED,
test-first, lane head `f2780d0a1`.

Postgres only (`session_factory`, blank schema). No live parser, no :8766, no API key.

## Item 1 - SF-1, brand-only resource_attachment ask (SCOPE CHANGED, captain ruling)

Original security finding: `turn_runtime.py::_without_scope_hint_matches` can empty
`compatible_entities` for a brand-only ask, and `_answered_unfiltered`'s own guard
(`unplaced_tokens`-gated) cannot see the drop because the resolver DID place the token -
only the SCOPE-HINT code discarded the match afterward. Reviewer's B1 (same commit range):
`_without_scope_hint_matches` / `reconcile._SCOPE_HINTS` are INERT for hand pass 11 defect
4 (only `entity_resolver._word_variants` carries the catalog/catalogue fix that closes it)
and change a seam every turn walks - captain ruling: DELETE both rather than guard them.
That deletion is the coder's job, not landed as of this file's own head. Scope narrowed to
the ONE invariant that must hold REGARDLESS of whether the scope-hint code exists: a
document-listing tool must never be called with no narrowing param at all - measured here
against `ENTITY_FILTER_REQUIRED_TOOLS`/`has_narrowing_filter`
(`lanes/business/fetch.py:361-391`, `lanes/business/__init__.py:1334-1349`), the guard
that already exists independently of the scope-hint code and refuses the fetch as a
`not_found` BEFORE any tool call when the built args carry nothing to narrow by.

No behaviour pin either way for what the reply LOOKS like (kind_pick vs miss vs a narrowed
attachment) - the captain's ruling is explicit that a kind_pick is acceptable there once
the scope-hint code is gone, and this file does not anticipate that deletion's shape.

## Item 2 - SF-2 / S1, company names must come from structured data

`answer_bridge.py::_companies_checked_in`/`_CHECKED_IN_RE` parses the ALREADY-COMPOSED
miss text with a regex matching "checked in " up to the first period - unanchored over prose that
quotes the customer's own raw entity tokens verbatim (`answer.py::label_token`,
`"<raw>"`). Two independent breaks, both measured directly in this worktree before this
file was written:

* A real company NAME containing an internal period ("Sdn. Bhd.") or the word "and"
  ("QQZ Lee and Sons Sdn. Bhd.") breaks the regex's own `[^.\n]+` (stops at the FIRST
  period, inside "Sdn.") and the comma/"and"-splitting logic - the minted options came back as
  `[{"label": "QQZ Lee", ...}, {"label": "Sons Sdn", ...}]`, neither a real company.
* An entity whose RAW contains the literal text `checked in Acme and Evil Corp.` (echoed
  into the "Couldn't find: ..." sentence, which composes BEFORE the real "checked in
  Mocha and Sorento." suffix) makes the regex's `.search()` match the INJECTED sentence
  first - the minted options came back as `[{"label": "Acme", ...}, {"label": "Evil
  Corp", ...}]`, attacker-chosen text with no relationship to which companies were
  actually searched.

Both measured on the REAL composer (`lanes/business/answer.py`'s miss builder) through
the real multi-company harness `test_rearch_r11_multi_company.py` already proved
(`_two_company_chain`-shaped seed, `_wire_real_resolve_entity`). The fix (reviewer S1) is
to read company names off `resolved`/`gate.compatible_entities` (structured data, the
same join `answer.py:2927-2941` already performs) rather than off the rendered sentence -
not implemented here; this file pins the OBSERVABLE outcome only.

## Item 3 - N-3 / S2, the HIT offer mints no pending

`apply_silent_company_offer` (multi-company HIT) and the zero-stock ladder's own HIT
offer both APPEND TEXT ONLY - neither calls `pending.ask(...)`. Measured directly: after
either offer, `open_question` is empty/None, and a following "yes" (a bare affirmative,
no company/team named in the customer's own words) reaches the escalation lane but with
the company/team the OFFER promised lost - `escalation_context`'s own `company_name`
comes back `None` (not Sorento) for the multi-company case, and `team` comes back the
carried-forward default `"customer_service"` (not `"warehouse"`) for the zero-stock
ladder case, where the offer's own team ("warehouse", from `crossdomain_zeroset`) never
reached the persisted routing state a plain "yes" carries forward from.
