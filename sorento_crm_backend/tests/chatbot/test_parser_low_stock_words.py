"""S7 RED tests - the parser knows the low stock words (#893).

`documentation/plans/scm/PLAN-low-stock-report.md` section S7;
`low-stock-report-acceptance-criteria.md` AC-70, AC-71.

`LOW_STOCK_ADDENDUM` is a new constant in `app/services/chatbot_parser_prompt.py`,
APPENDED to both published bodies the way `GROWTH_R1_ADDENDUM` and `LAST_COST_ADDENDUM`
already are - never woven in. The FULL body has to stay a mechanical derivation of the
live n8n system message (`test_parser_prompt_is_live.py`'s whole subject), and a trailing
block is the only edit shape that keeps that true.

**No LLM is called here, by design.** The repo's offline mechanism for this is the corpus
JSON beside `parser_growth_r1_phrases.json`: each row names a phrasing, the CUE the prompt
teaches it by, and the parse keys it must produce, and the test grades the CONTRACT between
the prompt, the declared vocabulary and the code. Whether the model obeys is the console
case's job (`tests/chatbot/console_cases/2026-09-14-low-stock-report.yaml`), not pytest's.
There is no offline golden that produces a real parse without a provider call, so none is
written - see the file's own note.

**One coupling the coder owes, which no test here can express:** appending a new addendum
breaks `test_parser_prompt_is_live.py::_without_growth_r1_addendum` and
`test_parser_growth_r1_reachability.py::test_the_addendum_is_appended_to_both_bodies`,
both of which strip a fixed chain of suffixes before asserting. `LAST_COST_ADDENDUM` had
to be added to that chain when it landed; `LOW_STOCK_ADDENDUM` has to be added the same
way, in the same commit. `test_the_addendum_stacks_after_last_cost` below pins the ORDER
those strips assume.
