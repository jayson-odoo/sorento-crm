"""The review findings on `feat/chatbot-growth-data`, one test class each.

Every one of these is a defect the unit tests of the feature passed straight over, because
each lives in the SECOND rendering of the same data: the grouped shape carries the rows a
second time, the ladder carries the absence a second time, and the summary carries the
filter a second time. That is the shape worth remembering more than any individual fix.

  blocker 1  the restricted-field drop ran over `items` only, so `group_by` rendered the
             supplier a dealer must never see - and `group_by=supplier` put it in the
             SECTION HEADING, where no field filter could ever reach it (AC-907, D4).
  blocker 2  the ladder read `nothing_codes` without `can_state_absence`, so a stock turn
             that printed a warehouse breakdown could get "no stock and no incoming, but a
             PO is placed" appended underneath the stock it had just shown.
  should-fix 4  a grouped answer renumbered the rows on screen and left `answers` flat, so
             a positional pick resolved to a different record than the one numbered.
  should-fix 9  AC-922 asks for "no PO", the code said "no purchase order".

Blocker 3 (company scope on the two new ToolSpecs) is graded where the other scoped tools
are: `sorento_crm_mcp/tests/test_company_scope_params.py`.

# Owner report, 8 Sep 2026 (the :8080 hands-on run). Six classes lived here, all
# built on the now-deleted `head/output_exchange.py::output_exchange`/
# `_switch_word_domain` (AC-1592, AC-1594). Queue item 2 (chatbot-turn-rearch,
# 16 Sep 2026): each measured against the CURRENT engine, not guessed - RETIRE
# or PORT, one rule named per class, nothing silently dropped.
#
# * **`TestD10AnIncomingAskTypesTheCodeAsAProduct`** - RETIRED. D10's own fix
#   (a container-hinted token that only resolves to a product is retyped) lives
#   now at `resolve_gate.retype_shipment_miss`, comprehensively covered by
#   `test_resolve_gate_unit.py::TestAShipmentHintedTokenThatIsOnlyAProductIsRetyped`
#   (9 tests, including this exact D10 turn and its "real shipment kept"/"genuine
#   miss left alone" negatives) - a duplicate, not a coverage hole.
#
# * **`TestOwner8SepPOAskTypesTheCodeAsAProduct`** (defect 1) - RETIRED. Measured
#   this session: `fetch.py`'s tool-param builder reads `entity_type` off the
#   GATE's `compatible_entities` (the resolver's own DB-matched type), never the
#   parser's `hint` field (grep-confirmed: `TYPE_TO_PARAM.get(entity_type)` at
#   the param-building loop). The old defect existed because the OLD pipeline's
#   fetch trusted the parser's hint; the new resolver-truth-first gate makes an
#   `order`-hinted product code answer as a product regardless, by construction -
#   structurally obsolete, not a regression to re-prove. The "carried scope
#   refused" half of the old class (a turn whose only current entity fails to
#   resolve falling back to a stale carried product) was NOT independently
#   re-verified this session - flagged, not silently assumed fixed.
#
# * **`TestOwner8SepANewAskIsNeverAnEscalationYes`** (defect 2) and
#   **`TestOwner8SepADeliveryWordPlusANameIsAnOrderAsk`** + **`TestReviewRound2B2
#   TheRetypeIsTheMeasuredArmOnly`** (defect 3, folded together - both exercise
#   the same switch-word-widened-guard mechanism) - PORTED AS RED in
#   `test_rearch_port_growth_r1_review_fixes.py`, against `turn/apply.py::apply`
#   + `turn/route.py::route` (the real APPLY/ROUTE seam, same pattern
#   `test_rearch_port_route_unit.py` already established for this file's sibling
#   port). Measured this session, not guessed: `_answer_offer` reads
#   `escalation.is_escalation_confirmation` with no defusing check for a decisive
#   intent plus a current entity (defect 2 reproduces), and `turn/apply.py` has
#   NO `switch_word`/`DOMAIN_SWITCH_WORDS` reference anywhere (grepped) - a cold
#   "delivery to hanlim" routes `out_of_scope` and the same turn over an open
#   offer re-asks `escalate_offer`, neither ever reaching `business_query`
#   (defect 3 reproduces). Confirmed regressions, not this tester's fix to make.
#
# * **`TestSwitchWordDomainOfThisMessage`** - RETIRED. Direct unit test of
#   `_switch_word_domain`, a function that no longer exists anywhere (module
#   deleted) - its own behaviour gap is what the ported defect-3 RED tests above
#   assert instead of a standalone test of a dead function.
