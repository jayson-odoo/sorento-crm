"""S21: which photograph of a product the system shows, and where that decision lives.

Written BEFORE the implementation. There is exactly ONE image decision in this system -
`product_attachments.is_primary` - and the quotation is its third consumer, after the brochure and
3D-model generation. Everything asserted here defends that single decision:

- **The flag, and nothing but the flag.** No fallback to the first-linked row, to the lowest
  `sort_order`, or to a filename that happens to contain the product code. That fallback is the
  defect `is_primary` exists to remove: for `SRTWC286-SH` the first-linked row is one of 31 files
  including a blank page and two other products' photographs, and a wrong photo is a wrong product
  in front of a customer.
- **"Nobody has chosen yet" is a state, not an absence.** 30 of 535 products with candidate photos
  carry a choice, so on day one almost every line is in that state. It has to be reportable, with
  the number of candidates, so a screen can say what is missing and how much work it would be.
- **A deleted file is deleted everywhere.** 611 of the live product-to-image links point at an
  attachment Resource Management considers deleted; signing a URL for one would render a broken
  picture on a customer's quotation.
- **A photograph is downscaled before it is embedded.** The mean chosen image in live data is
  1.1 MB and the largest is 4.3 MB. Fifty-two of those inlined would be a PDF nobody can email.

Postgres only, via ``blank_session``. Every row carries the ``zzt-pimg`` marker, because the dev
database this runs against holds a copy of production data.
