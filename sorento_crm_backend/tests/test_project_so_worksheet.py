"""Stage 1A: the AutoCount SO worksheet, read as JSON (PLAN-scm-front-planning 1.2, J02).

The worksheet screen shows the SAME document ``import_file`` writes as CSV, before anybody
downloads it. So the binding property here is not "the JSON looks reasonable" but "the JSON
and the CSV are the same document": one builder produces both, and the parity test at the
bottom is what stops them drifting the day a column is added to one of them.

``can_export`` is the server's own answer to "may this leave the building" (AC-A01): the
frontend never re-derives it. It is published-or-amended AND no unacknowledged hard finding,
which is the publish gate plus the fact that a draft is not a document yet.

Fixture builders are shared with ``test_project_so_draft`` rather than copied, for the same
reason ``test_project_so_delta`` shares them. Postgres only, via ``blank_session``; every row
carries the ``zzt-so`` marker those builders stamp.
