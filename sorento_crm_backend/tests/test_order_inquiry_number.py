"""An order inquiry has a NUMBER, not just an id.

`OI-2609-0001` (R3, `PLAN-oi-header-list-detail.md`): the MONTH of the header's own first
raise, Asia/Kuala_Lumpur, then a four-digit series that starts over every month - the
highest number this company has issued IN THAT MONTH, plus one. Superseded the flat
`OI-000001` (six digits, no month) this file used to pin; migration `523_oi_monthly_no_raises`
renumbers every pre-existing header and keeps the old value on `legacy_inquiry_no`. Until
this existed the only way to name what purchasing had been handed was a UUID, which nothing
in this product is allowed to show a person - and "the inquiry on SO414033" stops being an
answer the moment an amendment raises the second one.

The number is stamped by a `before_insert` listener on the model rather than by each writer,
so "no inquiry exists without a number" is structural: the two creation sites in the service
never mention it, and neither does any future one.

`tests/test_oi_monthly_number_and_raises.py` (S1 of that plan) is the primary suite for the
monthly scheme itself - the dated prefix, the MYT day-boundary edge, the never-re-minted
guard, the renumber migration. This file keeps only what that one does NOT already cover:
a gap in the series is never refilled (highest plus one, never the count), the database's
own uniqueness constraint, the confirmation flow's own minting path (`refresh_for_decision`,
not `ensure_inquiry`), and the detail read surviving the serialiser. Two tests that became
exact duplicates of the new file once rewritten to the dated format - "the first inquiry is
OI-000001" and "each inquiry takes the next number" (both just "N headers get consecutive
numbers", already covered by that file's AC-NO-01/AC-NO-02 tests) - are deleted rather than
kept as a second copy.

Postgres, blank scratch schema, rolled back at teardown, and every FK target real: the
uniqueness this slice leans on is a database constraint, so a test that ran anywhere else
would prove nothing about it.
