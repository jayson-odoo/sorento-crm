"""The fulfilment board shows the DELAYED ETA only to a viewer allowed that field.

Owner ruling 17 Oct 2026 ("depends on the field allowed"): `eta_delay_date` is a
`procurement.packing_lists.view_clearance` field (permission registry: absent from API
responses without it). A board viewer who holds it sees an incoming SPO dated by the delay;
everyone else sees the published `estimated_arrival_date`, and the delay date appears nowhere
in what they are sent - not as a date, and not through the overdue count worked out from it.

Both reads the board's screen makes are pinned: the board itself and the cell's stock drawer.

Postgres, blank scratch schema, every FK target seeded here (PRINCIPLES).
