"""Section 3.G - what an order inquiry has OCCUPIED on a purchase order.

`PLAN-scm-cs-planning-uat.md` section 3.G, UAC AC-G1 to AC-G5.

The captain, 25 August 2026, walking PO-2026/07-0029: "when an order inquiry occupies
quantity on a PO, the PO must show how much of its outstanding is occupied, by which OI and
SO, and at which location (PO line says DC1; the demand is at BRW-BB). It must live BESIDE
the PO line, not in it: the user re-keys the split in AutoCount and re-uploads, and an upload
overwriting our split would lose it."

`blank_session`, not `pg_session`: the assertions here are "this purchase order has exactly
these three placements" and "the list reports exactly these two orders", and the shared local
database holds the captain's real 80,000-line book. A scratch schema is the only substrate
where those are sentences a test may say out loud.

The wire shape is asserted through `PurchaseOrder.model_validate`, never off the service dict
alone: `response_model` silently DROPS a field the schema does not declare, which is exactly
how a carefully built block goes out empty.
