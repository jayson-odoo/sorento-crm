"""Design principle (documentation/reference/ADR-PRODUCT-STANDARDS.md §Data Model):

    Every domain table has a uuid `id` primary key.

Why it's a hard constraint, not a guideline: the polymorphic key columns
(`audit_logs.entity_id`, `conversation_sla_tracking.source_entity_id`,
`notifications.source_entity_id`, …) store a stringified id and can only be
typed uuid — with the type-safety that buys — if every id they might hold is
genuinely a uuid. One natural-key table (a `code`-keyed lookup) is enough to
force those columns back to text, and text silently accepts a `uuid = text`
mismatch that Postgres would otherwise reject at write time.

So this test walks the SQLAlchemy models and fails if any table lacks a uuid
`id`, UNLESS the table is in EXEMPTIONS below with a reason. A new table
therefore MUST either comply or be consciously added to the allowlist in a
reviewed diff — the default is compliance.

The allowlist is the honest record of what does not comply yet and why. It
should only ever shrink. Bringing a table into compliance = delete its line
(see 298_market_segments_uuid_id for the worked example).
