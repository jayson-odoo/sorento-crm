"""``response_write_allowed`` on the two detail responses (UAC O1).

The frontend used to mirror the backend's allowed-status lists in
``lib/response-gate.ts``. Two sources for one rule drift, and when they do the UI
either hides a working button or offers one that 422s. The server now states the
answer on the record, and the client reads it.

So the tests that matter here are not "is the flag true for status X" (that is a
restatement of the table). They are:

* the flag is DECLARED on the response model - a ``response_model`` silently drops
  what it does not name, and a dropped bool reads as "not allowed" on the client,
  hiding the response affordance on a perfectly writable record;
* the flag AGREES with what the write path enforces, status by status. If the flag
  can say yes where the gate says no, the mirror is back - just on one side.

Postgres only, blank scratch schema, every row seeded here under a marker.
