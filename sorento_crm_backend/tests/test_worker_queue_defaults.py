"""The worker must drain every queue something enqueues to.

`notification_service` enqueues all delivery jobs with `queue_name="notifications"`,
but the worker's default queue list omitted it, so those jobs were never drained:
86 `notification_deliveries` rows sat `pending` in production, 32 of them in a single
month, and it cost email as well as web push. The failure is silent by construction -
the enqueue succeeds, the row stays `pending`, and nothing raises.

These tests pin the default so the next queue added cannot quietly drop it again.

#569 split draining across two compose services by latency class (`worker` for slow
batch jobs, `worker_fast` for the short customer-facing ones) so a 39-minute import
never again sits in front of a chatbot media turn or a WhatsApp send. Compose names
only a ROLE on each service (`WORKER_ROLE: batch` / `WORKER_ROLE: fast`), never a
queue - `worker.QUEUES` is the single ordered registry mapping each queue to its
role, so adding a queue is a one-line edit there and these tests fail until it is
classified. See the PRODUCTION note above worker.QUEUES.
