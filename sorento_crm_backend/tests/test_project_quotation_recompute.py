"""S19 - recompute the guardrails on a version against TODAY's master data.

The client refused a bulk migration and asked for a button: "I need to have a recompute
button rather than you go and bulk write the data ... in case someone change at the master
data (product or any configuration), then the quotation can refresh to repull this".

They are right, and the reason is in the data. Both alerts are computed on line WRITE and
STORED on the line (AC-E7), which is correct for a quotation the customer holds and wrong
for one still being priced: the flags on a draft go stale the moment a series or a floor
moves, and nothing re-asks the question. So the fix has to be repeatable rather than a
one-off correction.

Three properties are pinned here:

1. It CORRECTS, in both directions - a line that is no longer non-standard loses the flag,
   and a line that has just fallen below a new floor gains one.
2. It REPORTS what moved. "6 lines are no longer non-standard" is the answer; a silent
   success toast is not.
3. It never touches a FROZEN or ISSUED version. Those flags are what was true when the
   customer was sent the paper, and rewriting them would rewrite quoted history.
