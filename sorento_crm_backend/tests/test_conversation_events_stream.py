"""GET /api/v1/sla-management/conversation-events/stream - the SSE half of S4.2.

UAC: documentation/plans/sla/conversation-intervention-tickets-acceptance-criteria.md
     AC-K1 (an inbound message reaches an open drawer within seconds)
     AC-K2 (nothing open, nothing subscribed - liveness costs nothing when idle)
     AC-K3 (the pending-tasks widget rides the SAME channel, not a second poller)
PLAN: documentation/plans/sla/PLAN-conversation-intervention-tickets.md (S4.2)

Run against a REAL uvicorn on an ephemeral port, not TestClient: both
``starlette.testclient`` and ``httpx.ASGITransport`` buffer the whole response
body before handing it back (verified in their source), which for an endpoint
that never ends is a hang, not a test. A real server also makes the disconnect
assertion honest - the client closes the socket, uvicorn cancels the handler,
and the subscription is released by the generator's own teardown, exactly as in
production.

The fake bus transport (tests/_event_bus_fake.py) is what makes "the
subscription was released" observable without sleeping and hoping.

Run:
