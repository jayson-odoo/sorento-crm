"""S14-S16: the price-floor approval gate (PLAN-quotation-approval-and-revision-request).

Written BEFORE the implementation. Every test here is red until the gate exists.

The one that matters most is the FIRST one, and it is worth saying why: the whole feature is
invisible to the ordinary quotation. Price floors already flag a line, but nothing enforced
them, so the change lands on a path every salesperson uses every day. A careless gate that
stamps a status on create, or counts "no floor configured" as a breach, would put an approval
step in front of quotations nobody ever meant to gate - and that failure looks like the feature
working. So it is pinned first and pinned hard: a quotation with no below-floor line writes no
status at all and issues exactly as it did before.

The rest state the gate itself:

- **Below floor and not approved cannot be issued** (DoD 2), refused with a code the screen
  can render rather than a sentence it has to pattern-match.
- **Approved issues, and issuing spends the approval** - the document lands on `issued`, so the
  NEXT revision that dips below the floor has to be approved again rather than riding on a
  decision a manager made about different prices.
- **Reject demands a reason** and writes it where the salesperson will read it.
- **The graph is the authority**: an illegal move is refused server-side, and the two rungs a
  manager owns (approved, rejected) are refused on the generic move route so they cannot be
  reached without the permission and the reason that belong to them.

Postgres only, via ``blank_session``. Every row carries the ``zzt-qapprove`` marker so nothing
here can touch the real data the dev database holds.
