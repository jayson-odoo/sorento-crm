"""The GRN and its SPO arrive in whatever order the supplier and the warehouse
produce them, and the link has to survive either order.

`grn_spo_matching` owns the allocation pool and the draw. The GRN lines import
draws from it going forwards; `forward_match_grn_lines_for_spo` draws from it
going backwards, over the lines a previous import stated but could not place.
Both directions run THE SAME code (AC-FM-26), which is what makes the two orders
produce the same rows (AC-FM-19).

Every test seeds its own chain from an empty schema - nothing here borrows a live
row, so the suite says the same thing in CI (empty database) as it does locally
(a copy of production).
