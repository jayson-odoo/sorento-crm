"""The gating logic in .github/workflows/deploy.yml, executed as it ships.

The workflow runs on `merge_group` and `workflow_dispatch` only (CI-ZERO-MINUTES,
14 Nov 2026: a PR's checks run in the lane sandbox, scripts/pr-gate.sh). The rules
pinned here:

1. Docs-only (job `changes`, step "Detect changed areas"): a merge-queue entry
   whose every path is documentation skips image build, every test suite and
   the deploy (owner ruling 29 Sep 2026). `DOCS_RE` names what counts as
   documentation, `NOT_DOCS_RE` names the documentation/ paths that tests READ
   as live inputs, and both ends of a rename count.
2. Release by dispatch (the jobs' `if` lines): a `workflow_dispatch` on main
   runs the full suite, the lean release tests or (with `skip_tests`) nothing,
   then build-images and build-and-deploy, which carries
   `environment: production` so the owner approves each deploy.
3. Merge gate (the jobs' `if` lines and the workflow `concurrency`): a
   merge-queue entry runs the full suite; there is no nightly (owner, 10 Oct
   2026, CI-LEAN); every run is its own concurrency group; every test job
   carries a timeout; the `CI gate (full)` job reports the queue run as one
   check (CI-MINUTES-CUT).
4. Changed tests on a lean release (`backend_tests` output of `changes`, and
   job `lean-gate` (`Release tests`) with its "Select the changed test files to
   run" step): the backend test files the batch changes run, minus what the
   checkout no longer holds and minus tests/ci_excluded.txt (CI-TESTS-ONLY).

The shell steps are extracted from the workflow file and executed under the
same bash flags GitHub uses, with a stub `gh` that answers every API call from
a canned payload through the real `jq` filter the step passes. The `if`
expressions are evaluated as written with a small evaluator for the operators
they use. So nothing here is a copy that can drift from the workflow: the test
scans every backend and MCP test for the documentation/ paths test code reads
and fails when one would classify as docs (extend NOT_DOCS_RE).

Needs `bash` and `jq`, which the CI runner has; skipped when the workflow file
is not present, which is the case inside the backend Docker image
(validate-backend's `pytest --collect-only` and its regression gate run there,
and the image holds only sorento_crm_backend/).
