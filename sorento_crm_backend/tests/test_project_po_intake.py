"""Customer PO intake and handwriting review cards (P4, P5; UAC groups D and M).

The unit tests here never call a model. They feed the persistence and arithmetic code a
canned page payload shaped exactly like ``document_extraction`` produces, because the
thing worth pinning is not that a vision model can read a page: it is that **what we do
with what it says** is right. Specifically, that

* a wrong amount is caught by our own Decimal multiplication and not believed,
* a strike-through arrives as a PROPOSED card and never as a cancelled line (D11),
* the same pencil note on a re-scan is the same note, carrying its decision forward,
* and a confirm is refused while any card is still proposed.

The last test in the file is different in kind. It runs the REAL extractor over the
client's REAL committed scan and asserts what was measured off it: every printed line,
every line's arithmetic, the cancellation card, and the successor PO number that exists
only in pencil. That is the difference between "we extract POs" and "we extract THIS PO
correctly" (AC-M1, AC-M2). It costs about two minutes and skips without a key.
