"""Two facts about how the supply service reads stock.

**A hold is keyed by the CORE line's product.** `_facts_for` judges a remapped mirror line
against its core line's product, and `_lock_stock` locks both spellings for that reason;
the hold that confirmation writes has to net out of the SAME product's free stock, or a
remapped line's Reserve leaves the core product reading as free as it was and the mirror's
product 20 short of nothing.

**A donor list is read from what the request already knows.** The board asks for donors
once per line, and each ask used to re-read the warehouse and project rows behind the
donors from the database. Once the caches behind a proposal are filled, a second ask
against a different quantity issues no SQL at all.

Postgres via `tests/_pg_fixture.py::blank_session`, seeding its own chain, with the Stage
1C suite's own helpers.
