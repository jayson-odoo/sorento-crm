"""`customers`: the model and the database must agree about every varchar width.

This table has now drifted from its model three times, and each time it cost a debugging
session rather than a review comment:

1. The unique index. `app/models/order.py` still declared the pre-305 global
   `uq_customers_code_name_lower` while the live index was
   `uq_customers_company_code_name_lower`, so a cross-company test failed on the test schema
   and passed in production (UAC AC-2.5).
2. and 3. Three column widths. The model declared `phone_number` String(50), `industry`
   String(120) and `website` String(500); the database held `varchar(20)`, `varchar(100)` and
   `varchar(255)`. A real 4,196-row AutoCount export carries 58 phone numbers longer than 20
   characters (`016-978 5508 (MR.CHAEH)`), so the importer's over-length pre-check - which read
   the MODEL - passed every one of them, promised 0 failures, and Postgres then refused all 58
   with `StringDataRightTruncation`. Migration 355 widened the columns.

A migration only resets the clock. This file is the part that keeps it: the model's declared
lengths are compared against the lengths the database actually has, so the next divergence is
a failing test instead of a preview that lies.

**On a `create_all` database the first test is a tautology, and that is expected.** CI builds
its schema from the ORM models (`scripts/bootstrap_env.py`), so there the two cannot disagree.
The drift only exists where migrations built the schema: the dev and production databases.
The test is still the right shape - it fails there, which is where it matters - and
`test_the_guard_notices_a_narrowed_column` proves the comparison is not vacuous by narrowing a
column for real and watching the guard report it.
