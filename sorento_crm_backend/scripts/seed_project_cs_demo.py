"""Seed the Tuju Residences demo so the lead-to-SO journey can be walked end to end.

The client's own documents are the acceptance test, but a document has nothing to
reconcile against on an empty database. Uploading their purchase order without the
quotation it was priced from produces a draft that cannot price a single line, which
looks like a broken feature rather than a missing prerequisite.

So this script lays down exactly the prerequisites and nothing more:

* the parties and the buyer, resolved to the REAL customer rows already in this
  database (`BUIMACO SDN BHD (PROJECT)`, `SLG CONSTRUCTION SDN BHD (PROJECT)`), because
  a client is a customers row that gets reused, never a duplicate;
* the project `TUJU RESIDENCE AT J`, carrying the filing reference `PS26-0143` that
  project sales admin writes on every piece of paper for this job;
* quotation `QT-004188` with all 60 of its lines, priced parents and their zero-priced
  companions, which is what makes set explosion and the PO cross-check possible;
* two leads, one waiting to be accepted and one not yet assigned, so the acceptance
  handshake has something to act on without pre-empting the walk-through.

The quotation lines are the real ones, transcribed from the committed PDF and verified
by arithmetic: every line satisfies quantity times unit price equals total, and the
sixty lines sum to exactly 1,805,907.02, which is the printed grand total. Six lines
resolve to no product in this catalogue (a connector and a bottle trap that are not in
the item master, one truncated description, and a code that exists only with a suffix).
Those are left unresolved ON PURPOSE: they are the real state of the catalogue, and the
sales order draft should raise them rather than have them quietly seeded away.

Idempotent. Re-running finds what exists by natural key and leaves it alone. The
`--reset` path deletes ONLY the rows this script creates, found by those same keys;
there is no unscoped delete anywhere in here, because this database is a copy of
production.
