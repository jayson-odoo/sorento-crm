"""Crew hand-test setup for PR #1679 (CANCEL-STOP-AT-SO). DEV COPIES ONLY.

Puts one real project SO line into the state the hand test needs: cancelled by an AutoCount
Cancel SO while a live order inquiry row still rests on it, with the Transfer to Cancel SO the
sync proposes for CS saved on its board line. It runs the cancel ingest the way the
`/external/ingest/cancel_sales_orders` route does (`AutocountCancelIngestService.ingest`, the
commit, then `run_cancel_hooks`), in this process, on the one database the guard below checked:
nothing goes over HTTP and no API key is needed.

Pick: an open line of an open or closed `project` SO that the Fulfilment Planning board would
read (`FulfilmentBoardService._crm_cancelled_rows`: SO status open / closed, demand_class
project, a project mirror line), with a live order inquiry row on that mirror line, not
cancelled by CS or by a cancel document, nothing cancelled or delivered against it in full, a
line key (`source_ref` ending in `:<DtlKey>`) unique on its SO, and no Cancel SO line naming
that SO yet. The XS (`XS-HT1679`, book `handtest`) cancels the whole ordered qty by that key,
so it matches exactly that line. Like every Cancel SO batch, it also retries the company's
cancel lines still waiting for their order, so those may link too.

Setup on a database where the hand-test XS is already live re-proposes the Transfer to Cancel
SO on its line (the state a line cancelled before the proposal existed needs) and changes
nothing else. `--undo` pushes the same XS again as voided (`Cancelled: T`): the cancel stops
counting, the line returns to the status its quantities give, `qty_cancelled` to 0 (plan R6)
and the proposal is withdrawn. The voided XS stays stored, like any voided AutoCount document;
setup after an undo makes it live again on the same line (if that line still qualifies).

Refuses unless the database this process is connected to is on this machine (the server
address Postgres itself reports, so a URL query string or PG* variable cannot point it
elsewhere) AND is a dev database by name: one of `KNOWN_DEV_DATABASES` (the crew shared dev DB,
`sorento_cagent_stack`), the exact name passed with `--allow-db`, or a name with a dev / ci /
test / copy segment. The same checks run for setup and for `--undo`. A unix socket or loopback
address is taken as this machine, so a local socket proxy or SSH tunnel to a remote server
would pass the address check and leave the name check as the only guard: dev copies only.

Run from sorento_crm_backend/ with the copy's env (its DATABASE_URL):
    venv/bin/python scripts/handtest_1679_setup.py
    venv/bin/python scripts/handtest_1679_setup.py --undo
Optional: --so <SO number> to pick that SO's first eligible line. `--ingest-url` is accepted
and ignored (earlier versions posted to the copy's backend).
