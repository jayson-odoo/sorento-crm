"""Dry run of the dealer targets Excel import against a local database (lane SALES-TARGET-DEALER).

For crew, on the owner's Mac: the real Sorento and Mocha files never leave it. This runs the
same import the screen's Test runs, in a transaction that is always rolled back, and prints the
per-row report. `--masked` prints only the rows that are not representable, as a reason
category plus the SHAPE of any quoted cell: digits become 9, and every word that is not a
layout keyword (RM, Additional, A/C, POINT, Q1, a month...) becomes x's, so no code, dealer or
account name survives and the output can be pasted on the PR.
