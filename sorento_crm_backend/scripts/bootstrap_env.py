"""Provision an empty Postgres database into a runnable Sorento CRM schema.

This is the reproducible environment bootstrap: it is what CI uses to build a
test database, and what a brand-new environment (or a disaster-recovery restore)
needs before the app can start.

WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN `alembic upgrade head`
--------------------------------------------------
The migration chain cannot build the schema from zero. Its first revision
(``001_add_is_responded_to_sla_tracking``) *alters* ``conversation_sla_tracking``,
and no migration ever creates that table - the original database was built by
SQLAlchemy ``create_all`` and every migration since has only ALTERed it. Running
``alembic upgrade head`` against an empty database therefore dies at revision
``008`` with "relation conversation_sla_tracking does not exist".

So the ORM models are the source of truth for the schema, exactly as they were
originally. This script makes that explicit and repeatable instead of implicit
and lost. Once the schema exists it is stamped at head so future migrations
apply normally.

Squashing the historical migrations into a real baseline revision would let
``alembic upgrade head`` work from zero and is the better long-term fix, but it
requires re-stamping existing databases - a separate, coordinated change.

USAGE

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost/sorento_ci python -m scripts.bootstrap_env

Idempotent: safe to re-run against an already-bootstrapped database.

    found by running the real app against a from-zero database:

    * migration 351 (`scm.reorder_policy.margin_floor_pct`, `.dead_turnover_months`) -
      no model column for either.
    * migration 352 (`scm.product_lifecycle_decision`) - the table has no ORM model at
      all; it is read/written through raw SQL only.
    * `product_suppliers.min_order_quantity` / `.is_primary` - these predate the
      migration chain entirely (part of the original hand-built schema, before 273
      introduced `moq` / `is_primary_supplier` as the modelled successors) and no
      migration ever creates them either, so there is no revision to replay. They are
      still read by `app.services.scm.reorder_level_service.supplier_constraints` via
      `COALESCE(ps.moq, ps.min_order_quantity)` / `ORDER BY ps.is_primary`, so a
      bootstrapped database needs the columns even though nothing ever writes them.
    * migration 306 (`ALTER COLUMN company_id SET DEFAULT <Sorento id>` on every owned
      table) - the model intentionally stays `nullable=True` at the ORM level (see
      `CompanyScopedMixin`'s docstring), so `create_all` never adds this DEFAULT. Without
      it, a raw `INSERT` that omits `company_id` (scripts, seeds, and plenty of test
      fixtures) lands NULL instead of Sorento, and the session-scoped company predicate
      (`app.services.company_scope_sql.company_sql_predicate`) then filters the row out
