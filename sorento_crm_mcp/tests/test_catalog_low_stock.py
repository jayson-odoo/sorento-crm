"""S6 RED tests - the MCP catalog entry for the low stock report (#892).

`documentation/plans/scm/PLAN-low-stock-report.md` section S6;
`low-stock-report-acceptance-criteria.md` AC-60, AC-62.

Written before the catalog entry exists, so `test_catalog_lists_low_stock_report_tool`
fails with `StopIteration` - no such tool name in `CATALOG` - which is the right reason.

**Why the tool is a GET even though it mints a file.** The compiler injects the opt-in
`view=render` parameter ONLY on presenter tools with no `body_params`
(`server.py::_compile_tool`), and the chatbot lane sends `view=render` on every call - so a
POST-with-body tool would never reach the presenter and the lane would get the raw route
body. `ToolSpec.read_only`'s own docstring already says method is transport, not semantics,
and `crm_portal_link_get` is the standing precedent for a tool that mints an artefact and
sits on the read list.
