"""S6 RED tests - the low stock report's render envelope (#892).

`low-stock-report-acceptance-criteria.md` AC-61; `PLAN-low-stock-report.md` section S6.

The route answers one of three shapes (`ready` / `pending` / `busy`, AC-43/AC-44/AC-49) and
`present_response` turns each into the minimal envelope the chatbot lane consumes verbatim
- `response` (the reply text), `has_result`, and for this tool `attachments`, which is what
makes the engine emit a `send_attachments` action.

Red today with a `KeyError`/shape mismatch, because `present_response` has no branch for
this tool and falls through to the generic item/field envelope (or returns `raw`
unchanged), which carries neither the two lines nor `attachments`.
