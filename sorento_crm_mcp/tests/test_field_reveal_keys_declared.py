"""Guardrail: every field-reveal key a presenter's `b.restrict()` call declares must also
be a static `(key, label)` pair on that tool's OWN `ToolSpec.restricted_fields`, and vice
versa.

Found live, 8 Sep 2026: `crm_inventory_stock_balance_list` and
`crm_procurement_purchase_orders_placed_list` both call `b.restrict(...)` in their
presenter to hide a field at render time, but neither `ToolSpec` declared
`restricted_fields` - so `mcp_tool_registry_service.sync_catalog` (which reads ONLY the
ToolSpec, never calls the tool) wrote an empty `mcp_tools.restricted_fields` for both, and
the Contacts > Access > Field reveals checklist (Slice C) had nothing to list or grant. The
render-time drop (`output_structurer`) worked; the admin surface that is supposed to let
someone grant the field back never saw it exist.
