"""Fix, 7 Sep 2026: `include_specs` / `include_sellable` / `include_pipeline` are opt-in
from the CALLER, not a default this shared MCP server injects for everybody.

`crm_inventory_stock_balance_list`, `crm_master_products_list` and
`crm_order_management_orders_list` are called through THIS ONE server by both n8n
(production business logic) and the CRM's own chatbot lane. `TOOL_DEFAULT_QUERY_PARAMS`
used to default `include_sellable` / `include_specs` ON here, which cannot tell those two
callers apart - so n8n started getting `open_so_qty` / `sellable` on every stock row and a
spec wall on every product row, with only the CRM's own renderer honouring
`restricted_fields`. n8n prints fields as given.

A call with the OLD parameter set - none of the three new params - must reach the backend
with a query dict that is EXACTLY what it would have been before this plan touched these
tools: the three keys simply absent, never present-and-false. That is the byte-identity
the owner asked to be proven, and the cheapest way to prove it is here, at the query this
server actually sends, rather than by diffing JSON against a captured fixture.

`documentation/plans/chatbot/PLAN-chatbot-growth-r1.md` Slice A;
`app/services/chatbot/lanes/business/fetch.py::entity_ids_transformer` is the CRM-side
half - it is what OPTS IN now, tested in the backend's own
`tests/chatbot/test_growth_fix_opt_in_envelope_fields.py`.
