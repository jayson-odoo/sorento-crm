"""Default-deny company scope for catalog tools (SEC-MCP-AUTH, 16 Oct 2026).

The backend resolves an X-API-Key call with no `contact_id` + `space_id` to EVERY company
(`sorento_crm_backend/app/services/company_scope_resolver.py::_resolve_api_key_scope`), and with
both present through `resolve_contact_company_scope`, which is fail-closed. So the one decision
left to this server is whether to ask at all: a tool that declares the pair is company-scoped, and
a call to it without both values is refused here, before any backend request.

The in-app staff AI assistant has no contact and opts out explicitly with `X-MCP-Scope: staff`
(set by the backend's `MCPRuntimeClient(staff=True)`, only at the assistant's own call sites). The
header only matters on an authenticated request, and a caller holding the token already holds the
key that reads every company, so the opt-out grants nothing new.
