"""The ideation-turn write tool for the MCP server (D6, AC-303, AC-307).

One tool is registered here:

- ``crm_ideation_turn``  POST  /api/v1/external/ideation/turn

It is an ``external=True`` catalog spec (see ``catalog.py``) and therefore has a
dedicated handler rather than the generic HTTP template, for one reason that
matters to the caller: the template types every body param as ``str``, so
``session_vars`` would arrive at the model as a STRING and the ideation pointer
(a nested object carried turn to turn) would have to be JSON-encoded by hand at
every call site. Here it is declared as an object, which is what the endpoint's
``IdeationTurnRequest`` actually takes and what the chatbot's ``ideate`` lane
already builds.

Path + method + description come from the shared ToolSpec so there is a single
source of truth for what the admin catalog shows and what this posts.

**The optional arguments are omitted, never sent as null.** ``media_selection``
in particular is behaviourally significant: the endpoint reads its ABSENCE as
"no media menu answer in this turn" (the n8n ``ideate-turn-http`` body omits it
for exactly that reason), and a null would be one more shape for the service to
have to read the same way.

**It IS a write tool, and the in-app assistant is told so by name.** The
assistant's gate matched a write-verb SUFFIX (``_create`` / ``_submit`` /
``_close`` ...) and this tool is named for the turn it runs, per AC-307 and the
lane that calls it - so it read as a read tool and neither the write-confirm gate
nor the prompt dry-run suppression applied to it. The NAME is a published
contract (this catalog and n8n both reference it), so it stays and write-ness is
declared instead: ``ai_assistant_service._WRITE_TOOL_NAMES`` lists it, and
``_WRITE_TOOL_PERMISSIONS`` requires ``ideation.board.view`` of the confirming
user. The chatbot's ``ideate`` lane, which is what this exists for, calls it
without a confirm because there is no user there to ask - its own guard is D14:
a dry-run turn does not call it at all.
