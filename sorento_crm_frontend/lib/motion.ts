 * belongs on a momentum-carrying gesture (see the apple-design skill,
 * "Behavior over animation" - damping 1.0 is the default, bounce is reserved
 * for a gesture that already carried momentum).
 *
 * `visualDuration` is Apple's "response" half of the damping/response pair,
 * tuned to match `--duration-slow` (300ms, css/config.reui.css) so a JS
 * spring and this app's CSS transitions read at the same pace.
 *
 * A spring re-targets from wherever the value currently sits, so re-opening a
 * surface mid-close continues from its live scale/opacity instead of jumping
 * back to 0 - that is what makes it "interruptible" (S8-01).
