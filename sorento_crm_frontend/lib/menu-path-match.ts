/**
 * Which menu entry is the user actually on.
 *
 * Two rules, and both exist because of a real wrong answer:
 *
 * 1. A prefix has to stop on a segment boundary. `pathname.startsWith(path)` also matched a
 *    sibling whose name merely begins with the same letters, so `/scm-archive` lit up `/scm`.
 *
 * 2. The most specific entry wins. A section landing page is a prefix of every page in its
 *    section, so `/scm` (Supply Chain -> Dashboard) stayed highlighted on Sales Orders, Reorder
 *    Planning and every other SCM page. Two entries highlighted at once is worse than none:
 *    the sidebar is how the user knows where they are.
 *
 * Rule 2 is decided against the VISIBLE menu, not against the route table. An entry the user
 * cannot see (no permission, module off) must not suppress one they can, or a page would show
 * no highlight at all.
