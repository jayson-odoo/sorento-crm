/**
 * S1-05 (repaired in S5) - the grid owns the horizontal scrollport, alone.
 *
 * S1 gave `DataGridTable` its own `overflow-x-auto` scroller and a definite
 * `min-width` on the table. It still did not scroll: 161 lists wrapped the grid
 * in a Radix `<ScrollArea>`, whose viewport puts a `display: table` element
 * between the scroller and the table. That ancestor shrink-fits, so
 * `data-grid-scroller` measured `scrollWidth === clientWidth` (2178 === 2178 on
 * Orders at 1280), never overflowed, and yet still ate the wheel gesture
 * through `overscroll-x-contain`. The only element that COULD scroll was the
 * Radix viewport, and it never received the event. Net effect: no list scrolled
 * sideways, the right-edge fade never appeared, and the phone pin had nothing
 * to pin against.
 *
 * This is a source scan and not a render test for the same reason
 * `PageHeader.inventory.test.ts` is: what it asserts is a property of the whole
 * tree ("no list re-introduces a second scrollport around the grid"), and a
 * render test can only speak for the one page it mounted. The 162nd
 * copy-pasted `<ScrollArea><DataGridTable /></ScrollArea>` would pass every
 * component test in the repo and fail here, which is the point.
 *
 * If you are adding a list: render `<DataGridTable />` bare inside `CardTable`.
 * The grid brings its own scroller.

 * uses for the ScrollArea rule: a file that gains or loses an occurrence without a
 * matching edit here fails loudly instead of drifting silently. `PoPlanCard.tsx` is the
