/**
 * Every place a DataGrid renders inside ANOTHER grid's body, named once.
 *
 * `DataGrid` handles this itself now - a grid that finds an enclosing
 * `DataGridContext` renders unbounded and non-sticky, so it cannot open a
 * scrollport inside a scrollport (`data-grid.nested.test.tsx` proves the
 * behaviour). This file is the other half: a CENSUS, so a new nesting site is a
 * deliberate entry rather than a surprise, and so the reasons stay written down.
 *
 * Why the census is worth having when the default already covers the sites: the
 * default reads REACT context, and two shapes escape it. A grid whose enclosing
 * table is one of the hand-rolled `<table>` carve-outs has no context to read
 * (`CellStockTable` is exactly that, and it is where the production defect was);
 * and a grid rendered through something that breaks the React tree rather than
 * only the DOM tree would too. Neither is caught by a component test, because
 * each is a property of a pair of files rather than of one.
 *
 * Three scans, matching the three shapes nesting takes:
 *
 *   1. `meta.expandedContent` - the row expansion. `DataGridTable` renders it
 *      inside the grid's own provider.
 *   2. a grid-bearing component rendered INSIDE the `<DataGrid>` / `<PanelDataGrid>`
 *      JSX of another - a dialog a list opens and keeps in its own subtree.
 *   3. a grid inside a popover / dialog / sheet. React context reaches a portalled
 *      child, so a popover opened from a CELL is nested even though its columns
 *      array puts it nowhere near the grid in the source.
 *
 * Both scans over-report on purpose (a component whose FILE renders a grid is
 * treated as grid-bearing). Every hit below was read by hand and carries what it
 * actually renders.
