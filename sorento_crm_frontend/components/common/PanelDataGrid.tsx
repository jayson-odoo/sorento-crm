/**
 * The system list, inside a detail tab.
 *
 * Every tab on a project or lead was showing its rows a different way: a `ul` with a
 * divider here, a grid of bordered cards there, a bespoke timeline somewhere else. The
 * client's words: "use our system design principle for the list" and "don't use this out
 * of system design punya list". A record read as a card in one tab and a row in the next
 * teaches nothing that carries over.
 *
 * So all of them render THIS, which is the same `DataGrid` the top-level listings use, with
 * the contract from ARCHITECTURE-RULES already applied: fixed table layout, resizable
 * columns, `onChange` resize mode, and the same pagination bar as the user list -- "1 - 1 of 1",
 * a page picker and a rows-per-page selector, shown WHENEVER there are rows. It was previously
 * hidden below one page, which is exactly what made a short list look like a different component
 * from the long one. Callers supply columns with explicit sizes, and nothing else.
 *
 * The row is the way in (ADR 1d), so pass `onRowClick` rather than adding an action column.
