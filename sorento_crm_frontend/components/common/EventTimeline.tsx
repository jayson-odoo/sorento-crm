/**
 * A HISTORY, shown the way delivery tracking and Sheets version history show one.
 *
 * The client's words: "our audit trails and activities UI should be like those tracking
 * systems like Lazada, Shopee, Lalamove, or even Google Sheet history tracking - like it is
 * a timeline that explains what happens at what time".
 *
 * This is the one place the system does NOT use a DataGrid, and the distinction is worth
 * stating because it decides which to reach for:
 *
 * - A list of RECORDS (quotations, POs, stakeholders) is a grid. You scan a column, sort it,
 *   compare two rows, click one to open it.
 * - A HISTORY of events is a timeline. Nobody sorts their parcel tracking by courier name.
 *   What you want is the sequence and the gaps in it, and a rail with dots down one side is
 *   what makes "then, three days later" visible at a glance. A table of timestamps hides it.
 *
 * Shape: newest first, grouped under a date heading so the day is said once instead of on
 * every row, absolute times (ADR 1d - "3 days ago" cannot be compared between two rows and
 * rots while the page is open), and the rail drawn continuous between dots so a reader sees
 * one thread rather than a stack of cards.
