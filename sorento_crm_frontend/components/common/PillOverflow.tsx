/**
 * A row of pills that folds whatever does not fit into one "+N" pill (S3b, R-J: "the cell
 * shows as many as its width fits and folds the rest into a '+N' pill; clicking any pill,
 * '+N' included, opens the composition").
 *
 * NO FIXED COUNT. A `ResizeObserver` on the row's own container reacts to the DataGrid column
 * being dragged wider live (`columnsResizable`), the same way `useHorizontalOverflow` reacts to
 * a scroll container's size - the count of pills shown is read off the container's actual
 * width every time it changes, never off a breakpoint or a guess.
 *
 * MEASURED, NOT GUESSED. A hidden row renders every pill once, off-screen but laid out, so
 * `offsetWidth` is the real rendered width in this font at this size - not an estimate that
 * drifts the moment a label gets longer. The visible row and the measuring row share the same
 * pill markup for that reason.
 *
 * A QUANTITY IS NEVER CUT (S3b fix). Pill 0 always renders at its own natural width - never
 * capped below its content to leave room for "+N" beside it. When the two do not both fit on
 * one line, "+N" wraps to a second line instead (`flex-wrap` on the visible row); pill 0's
 * text is never the thing that gives.
 *
 * ONE POPOVER FOR THE WHOLE ROW. Every pill, "+N" included, is a plain, unlabelled trigger for
 * the SAME popover (`renderPopover` renders every item, not only the folded ones) - the
 * captain's rule is "clicking any pill ... opens the composition", not "each pill opens its
 * own fact". A single controlled `Popover` wraps the row so any pill's click reaches it.
 *
 * THE CLICK NEVER REACHES THE ROW BEHIND IT. A DataGrid row expands on click and, on the
 * board grid, the whole cell is itself a `<button>` (`FulfilmentBoardMatrix`); a pill's click
 * would otherwise open BOTH the popover and the row/cell underneath it. The outer wrapper
 * stops the click after the inner trigger has already toggled the popover.
 *
 * Pills are `role="button"` `<span>`s, never `<button>`, on purpose: the board grid nests this
 * component INSIDE a `<button>` cell, and a `<button>` cannot legally contain another one (the
 * grid's own annotation comment documents the same rule for a table). One shape, everywhere,
 * rather than a button variant for two call sites and a span variant for the third.
