/**
 * Every Radix menu/select/popover/dialog surface is portalled to `<body>`, so a click,
 * wheel, or focus event landing in one reports a target with no DOM ancestry back to
 * whatever opened it. Code that reads "not a descendant of the thing I own" as "outside"
 * - a dialog's outside-click guard, an inline editor's row-commit guard - needs to treat
 * these surfaces as still-inside instead, or it dismisses/discards the very thing the
 * person is interacting with. One selector, shared, so `dialog.tsx`'s outside-click guard
 * and `InlineLineTable`'s row-commit guard cannot drift into two different lists of the
 * same concept.
 *
 * `[data-radix-focus-guard]` is Radix's own tab-trap sentinel, appended as a direct child
 * of `<body>` (a sibling of every portal root, not a descendant of any of them) - a focus
 * hop through one is a transient step INSIDE a modal's focus trap, not a departure from it.
