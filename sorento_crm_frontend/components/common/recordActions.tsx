/**
 * One action set per entity, shown in two places (D15).
 *
 * An entity declares its actions once, in
 * `app/(protected)/<module>/<entity>/actions.tsx`, as
 * `use<Entity>Actions(record) -> { actions, dialogs }`. The record page renders
 * them in the gear (`DetailActions`) and the list row renders the SAME array, in
 * the same order, in its "..." menu (`RowActionsMenu`), so an action can never be
 * reachable from one surface and missing from the other.
 *
 * Permissions are resolved once, inside the definition hook: an action the user
 * may not run is simply not in the array. That is why there is no `permission`
 * field here - nothing downstream could act on it, and a second check is a second
 * place to get it wrong.
 *
 * `dialogs` is the node the definition hook needs mounted (an impersonation
 * prompt, a form). Both surfaces render it, so a list row and a record page open
 * the very same one. A destructive action has no dialog to mount since S6: it
 * parks a pending action and hands its countdown back as `pending`, which the
 * record page passes to `DetailActions` and a list row leaves to the toast.
