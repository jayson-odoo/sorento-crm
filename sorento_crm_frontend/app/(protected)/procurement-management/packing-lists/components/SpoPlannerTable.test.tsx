/**
 * The already-converted state's Delete action (`PLAN-scm-proforma-to-spo.md`'s third
 * amendment, captain live case 21 Aug): the AlertDialog names the SPO numbers and count
 * per ADR-PRODUCT-STANDARDS, the delete actually fires the DELETE route, and a self-heal
 * note (a stale link cleaned up on read) shows as an informational banner rather than a
 * toast. The confirm-table (non-converted) path was exercised by `CreateSpoPanel.test.tsx`'s
 * older sibling before that file was deleted (F5, review round 2: `CreateSpoPanel.tsx` was
 * dead, imported nowhere); this file covers what changed on `SpoPlannerTable` itself.
 *
 * A note on the query style here: a `findBy*` result is never used directly -
 * the find is awaited, then the SAME query is repeated with `getBy*`, and that
 * node is the one clicked or asserted on. `findBy*` resolves inside RTL's `act`,
 * and the flush on the way out re-renders this grid and replaces its cells, so
 * the node the find handed back is already detached: an assertion on it reads
 * "element could not be found in the document" and a click on it does nothing at
 * all. That used to be masked by the `ScrollArea` this list wrapped its grid in,
 * which delayed the table's first DOM; the wrapper is gone (it stopped the grid
 * from scrolling sideways), so the pattern has to be explicit.

/**
 * Live bug (captain, 4 Sep): the SPO qty input lost focus after EVERY keystroke, so the
 * operator had to click back into it for each digit.
 *
 * `flexRender` renders a column's `cell` FUNCTION as a React component type
 * (`createElement(columnDef.cell, ctx)`), so a `columns` array rebuilt on each keystroke
 * hands React a new element TYPE for every cell - which unmounts the old input and mounts
 * a fresh one, taking the caret with it. The assertion is node IDENTITY: the element that
 * had focus before the change is still `document.activeElement` after it.
