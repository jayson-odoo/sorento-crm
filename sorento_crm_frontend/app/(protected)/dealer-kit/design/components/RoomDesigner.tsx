 * moves the box in 3D because there is only one array of boxes - the moment
 * they become separate models they start disagreeing, and the user is the one
 * who finds out.
 *
 * **The Selection is the source of truth for WHAT, the room for WHERE.** Which
 * products and how many lives on the server and comes back priced for whoever
 * is looking; the outline and the placements are saved alongside it. Nothing
 * price-shaped is computed here - a designer that did its own arithmetic would
 * be a second price list nobody knew they were maintaining.
 *
 * Sizes come from the Selection too, so a box is at the product's real
 * dimensions when the catalogue has them and an obvious placeholder when it
 * does not (AC-V1, AC-V2).
