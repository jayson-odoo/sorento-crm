/**
 * Give a canvas the whole window.
 *
 * The page builder and the room designer are the two screens where the app
 * chrome actively costs you: the top bar, the sidebar, the breadcrumb and the
 * page heading together take roughly 200px of height and 280px of width, and
 * both of those are canvas. Everywhere else in the CRM that chrome is how you
 * navigate; here you are working inside one screen for minutes at a time.
 *
 * Implemented by taking the panel OUT of the page flow rather than by hiding the
 * chrome in place. Hiding the shell means reaching across the app to toggle
 * layout state that every other screen shares, and the first regression lands on
 * a page that has nothing to do with the Dealer Kit. A fixed overlay is local,
 * reversible, and cannot leak.
 *
 * Escape exits, because anything that covers the whole window and traps you is
 * worse than the chrome it removed.
