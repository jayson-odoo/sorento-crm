/**
 * Conversation intervention tickets - feature service.
 *
 * Contract: documentation/plans/sla/conversation-intervention-tickets-acceptance-criteria.md
 * Plan:     documentation/plans/sla/PLAN-conversation-intervention-tickets.md
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * PHASE 2 (this file today): every function below calls the real backend
 * (S2.7). The worklist itself is NOT fetched here - a ticket is just a row on
 * the existing `/my-pending` response (`getMyPendingSLA` in
 * `conversationSLATrackingService.ts`) flagged `is_intervention_ticket: true`;
 * this file only covers what's specific to a ticket once it's opened (detail,
 * thread, send, resolve). The Phase 1 in-memory fixtures under `./__mocks__/`
 * have been deleted along with the merge logic in `MyPendingSLAWidget`.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * API CONTRACT (as implemented)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * All paths are under `/api/v1/sla-management/conversation-sla-tracking`.
 * Datetimes are naive UTC strings (backend convention) rendered through
 * `formatDateTimeInMalaysia` / `parseDateTimeAsUTC`.
 *
 * A. CREATE (n8n -> CRM, existing route, extended) - UAC AC-A1/A2/A4
 *    POST /integration
 *    Request (additive to today's `ConversationSLATrackingCreate`):
 *      {
 *        contact_phone_number: string,      // required, existing
 *        agent_code: string,                // required, existing
 *        team_set_code: string,             // required, existing
 *        assigned_to_id?: string,           // existing (round-robin / explicit)
 *        message_id?: string,               // existing (kept for back-compat)
 *        source_message_id: string,         // NEW: the triggering message id.
 *                                           //      Identity + idempotency key.
 *        source_message_text?: string       // NEW: enquiry snippet source text
 *      }
 *    Response 200 (additive; every field n8n reads today is preserved):
 *      {
 *        status: 'success',
 *        message: string,
 *        tracking_id: string,
 *        is_update: boolean,
 *        already_active: boolean,           // true on a same source_message_id retry
 *        in_working_hours: boolean,         // NEW (R4): n8n picks in-hours vs
 *                                           //      out-of-hours auto-reply copy
 *        initiated_at: string,              // real request time
 *        due_at: string | null,             // response deadline (clock start is
 *                                           //      normalized to the next working window)
 *        due_at_resolution: string | null,
 *        assigned_to: string | null,
 *        assigned_to_id: string | null
 *      }
 *    NOTE for the Phase 2 implementer: today's `/integration` route returns only
 *    `status/message/tracking_id/is_update/already_active`. The four clock/assignee
 *    fields AC-A2 requires plus `in_working_hours` are a delta to add there.
 *    Multi-open is the rule: a new `source_message_id` for a contact that already
 *    has an open ticket creates a SECOND open ticket (never merges).
 *
 * B. WORKLIST (existing `/my-pending`, extended) - UAC AC-B1
 *    GET /my-pending?limit=<n>   ->  { data: MyPendingSLAItem[] }
 *    Conversation-scope rows gain (see `InterventionTicketListItem`):
 *      is_intervention_ticket: true   // explicit from the backend, never re-derived
 *                                     //   here (same rule as `is_form_sla`)
 *      contact_name, contact_phone, enquiry_snippet, source_message_id,
 *      team_label, initiated_at, escalated_at
 *    Rows are NOT de-duplicated by contact: two open tickets for one contact are
 *    two rows, each with its own `due_at` / `due_at_resolution` / tier.
 *
 * C. TICKET DETAIL (drawer header + composer state) - UAC AC-C1
 *    GET /{tracking_id}/ticket   ->  InterventionTicketDetail
 *    Assignee-or-manager scoped. `window` + `chat_template` come from the same
 *    backend window/template service the shared composer uses, returned inline so
 *    the drawer opens in one round trip.
 *
 * D. THREAD (shared contact conversation) - UAC AC-C2
 *    GET /{tracking_id}/conversation?limit=&cursor=   (EXISTING route)
 *      -> { items: RespondMessageItem[], pagination?: {...}, error?: string }
 *    Siblings for the same contact return the SAME thread; only the header and
 *    clocks differ.
 *    NOT implemented here: this is the same route the SLA detail page's
 *    conversation panel reads, so the drawer uses the SAME service + hook
 *    (`getSlaTrackingConversation` / `useSlaTrackingConversation` in
 *    `conversationSLATrackingService` / `useConversationSLATracking`) under the
 *    ONE query key `['sla-tracking-conversation', id, limit, cursor]`. A second
 *    copy under its own key meant a send from the drawer never refreshed the
 *    detail page's panel, and dropped the cursor pagination the shared service
 *    already supports.
 *
 * E. SEND (ticket-stamped) - UAC AC-D1/D2/D3, AC-E1
 *    POST /{tracking_id}/ticket/send
 *      JSON body when there are no files:
 *        { text: string }
 *      multipart/form-data when files are attached:
 *        text, files[] (repeated)
 *    Response 200: SendTicketMessageResult
 *    Semantics the backend owns:
 *      - in-window  -> raw text; out-of-window -> the existing `*_chat` template
 *        smart-send (same `send_text_or_template` path as the unified composer)
 *      - attachments are uploaded through CRM storage and delivered to Respond by
 *        URL (CMYK JPEG converted to RGB)
 *      - the send is stamped with THIS tracking id: it sets
 *        is_responded / responded_at / responded_by / response_time on this ticket
 *        only; sibling tickets for the same contact are untouched
 *      - an `integration_log` outbox row is written on success AND failure
 *      - a multi-file send is NEVER all-or-nothing and never 502s on one file:
 *        the caption ships first, attachments go sequentially and stop at the
 *        first failure, and the call returns 200 with
 *        `attachments: { delivered: string[], failed: {filename, error} | null }`.
 *        The composer clears ONLY the delivered files and keeps the rest staged,
 *        so a retry cannot resend what the contact already has.
 *    R1 (resolved 2026-08-12): Respond.io supports text / attachment
 *    (image, video, audio, file) / quick_reply / whatsapp_template. There is NO
 *    sticker type and NO reply-to/context parameter, so:
 *      - the composer has no sticker affordance at all
 *      - there is no outbound "reply to" at all. The ">"-prefix emulation was
 *        removed on 2026-08-16: it read like a real quote and was not one.
 *        The route still ACCEPTS optional `reply_to_message_id` /
 *        `reply_to_excerpt` (audit-only), and the FE no longer sends them.
 *        Inbound quoted context (the contact quoting us) is unaffected - it is
 *        real, comes from Respond's structured `replyTo`, and still renders.
 *
 * E2. MANUAL TEMPLATE SEND (the composer's "Send template" dialog) - AC-E1
 *    POST /{tracking_id}/conversation/template-message
 *      { template_id, params, tracking_id? }
 *    The shared chat route (every chat surface mounts it), queued on the
 *    respond_io worker. `tracking_id` is the ticket the template answers: the
 *    worker stamps THAT ticket's response clock once the send succeeds, so an
 *    out-of-window template reply stops the clock exactly like a text reply.
 *    Omitted by every other surface. The worker only honours it when the
 *    ticket's contact is the one that received the template.
 *
 * F. RESOLVE - UAC AC-C3
 *    POST /{tracking_id}/resolve   (EXISTING route)
 *    For an intervention ticket it resolves THAT row only: sibling tickets stay
 *    open and NO Respond.io conversation-close call is made (Respond is a message
 *    pipe; conversation state is not ours to change).
