/**
 * One list holding products AND product sets, for every place a person answers "what does
 * this supplier's code mean" (F12, R20).
 *
 * The supplier sells the whole WC. `CWC605-RL` is our SET - pedestal plus cistern - and no
 * product carries that code, so a picker that could only offer products could not express
 * the true answer and the operator's only options were the wrong half or Dismiss.
 *
 * Shared by the unmatched-code queue's inline select and the proforma detail's Match dialog,
 * because the two answer the same question and a list that differed between them would make
 * the same code answerable one way on one screen and another way on the other.
 *
 * SERVER-SEARCHED and paginated on the product side: the product master is tens of thousands
 * of rows, and a dropdown holding one cached page silently hides the item the operator is
 * looking for - the mistake this codebase has made twice. Sets are asked for on the FIRST
 * page only: there are two orders of magnitude fewer of them, so one page is the whole
 * answer, and repeating them under every "Load more" would be noise.
