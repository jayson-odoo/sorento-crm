/**
 * The purchase-order detail, built section for section as the twin of `SalesOrderDetail`.
 *
 * The captain's instruction was that the two books must look very alike, because one is
 * buying and the other is selling and nothing else about them differs: a planner who has
 * learnt where a figure lives on one has learnt it on the other. So this screen carries the
 * SAME header shape, the SAME three two-column cards, the SAME lines grid with its totals
 * row, search, column picker and pager, and the SAME in-place edit session. Where they
 * differ, they differ because the DOMAIN differs - goods are received rather than delivered,
 * so the delivery panel is a goods-receipt panel and the counterparty is a supplier.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACED. A flat four-across grid of eight fields, no Edit at all, a read-only
 * five-column lines table with no footer, no search and no pager, and two duplicate
 * status-word maps (one here, one on the list) that disagreed with each other.
 *
 * VIEW AND EDIT ARE THE SAME SCREEN. Editing swaps a read-only value for an input IN PLACE -
 * the same fields, in the same order, in the same card, in the same tab. Editable: Order
 * date, Delivery date, Supplier. Lines: Product, Qty ordered, Unit price, Discount, UoM,
 * Location and Delivery date. Everything else (Source, Currency, Supplier code, Qty
 * received, the totals) has no edit counterpart and stays exactly where it was.
 *
 * One Save writes the whole header, plus the lines ONLY when they actually moved - see
 * `lineSignature` - because the PUT upserts the WHOLE `lines` array when the key is sent at
 * all. The service matches each sent line to an existing row by `id` FIRST (this form sends
 * it) or by SKU otherwise, so a matched line keeps its id, its `qty_received` and its
 * `source_system`; only an unmatched existing line is deleted, and the backend refuses that
 * with a 409 when goods have been received against it or a sales order still claims it.
 *
 * MONEY IS A STRING END TO END, and it is in the SUPPLIER's currency. The backend sends
 * `Decimal`, which Pydantic serialises as a string, and every sum here goes through
 * `project-sales/_shared/lib/money` rather than `Number()`. The book is mostly USD, so
 * every figure is labelled with the currency the order was written in - "RM 12.50" against a
 * USD purchase order is a wrong number, not a formatting detail.
