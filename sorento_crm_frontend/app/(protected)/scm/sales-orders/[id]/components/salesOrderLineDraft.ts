/**
 * The line-edit draft, and the one rule that reads it from outside the component.
 *
 * ITS OWN MODULE, deliberately. These used to live in `SalesOrderDetail.tsx`, and exporting
 * a value that is not a React component from a component file takes that file OUT of React
 * Fast Refresh: Next then does a FULL PAGE RELOAD for any edit to it, in Next's own words -
 *
 *   "Fast Refresh will perform a full reload when you edit a file that's imported by modules
 *    outside of the React rendering tree. You might have a file which exports a React
 *    component but also exports a value that is imported by a non-React component file.
 *    Consider migrating the non-React component export to a separate file and importing it
 *    into both files."
 *
 * Measured in the browser on 13 September 2026: with the resolver exported from the
 * component file, one edit under the running dev server wiped an OPEN edit session - the
 * page came back in view mode with the route's own query string, so Remove line and Save
 * landed on a tree that no longer had a session, sent nothing, and said nothing. Splitting
 * the module restores the state-preserving refresh.

 * neither source can label: a stale row label over somebody else's SKU would be worse than
