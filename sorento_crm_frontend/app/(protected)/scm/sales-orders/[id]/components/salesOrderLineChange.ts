/**
 * The batch row behind one sales-order line, as the board's own What-changed dialog reads it.
 *
 * WHY THIS SCREEN AT ALL: once Apply has run on a CANCELLED line the line is closed, and a
 * closed line has no cell on the fulfilment board - so the dialog that says where its held
 * quantity went (`Reallocate 202607-S0080 3 to pool`) has nowhere left to open. The line is
 * still on this order, and this is where CS looks next, so the same reading is offered here.
 *
 * ITS OWN MODULE, beside `salesOrderLineDraft.ts` and for the same measured reason: a
 * `'use client'` component file that exports a value which is not a component drops out of
 * React Fast Refresh, and every edit to it then full-reloads the page and wipes the edit
 * session (13 September 2026).
 *
 * THE SIDES: the line carries the batch row's IDENTITY, its RESULT and its own `from`/`to`
 * sides, mapped here exactly as the board's `annotationOf` does (the Now is null once the
 * line is closed, and the decision stays null: this screen has no held or proposed parts).
 * A cancelled row says the one word the book actually said - `changedFieldsOf` prints
 * "Cancelled" off `closed` alone. `lineNo` is 0 because this grid has no line
 * numbers of its own; the dialog titles itself with the item code instead.
