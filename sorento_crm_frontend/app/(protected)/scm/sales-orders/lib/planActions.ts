/**
 * "Plan selected (N)" - the sales-order list's way onto the fulfilment board.
 *
 * It is the toolbar's own primary button (the owner's ruling, 22 Sep 2026), and NOT in the
 * bulk strip. The strip only exists once rows are ticked, so an action that lives there
 * cannot be found by someone who has not already guessed it is there - and when it refused
 * (over the board's bound) it refused as a greyed-out button whose reason was a hover away,
 * which is indistinguishable from a dead click.
 *
 * The one thing this list starts is taking a set of orders to the board, so that is the CTA:
 * always present (while the caller holds the permission), always counting what is selected,
 * and stating its own refusal on itself via a tooltip.
 *
 * There is no plan ENTITY behind it. The fulfilment board is a URL
 * (`/project-sales/fulfilment-planning?orders=SO1,SO2`) and stays one, so this action
 * navigates and saves nothing: nothing is created by pressing it, and the same link can be
 * kept or sent.
 *
 * Two refusals, and they say different things:
 *
 * * with nothing ticked, and over the board's own bound, the item is DISABLED with the
 *   reason on it rather than hidden - the user is entitled to know the action exists and
 *   what it wants from them;
 * * without the permission the board's page requires, nothing renders at all. Offering a
 *   door that answers 403 is worse than not offering it.
