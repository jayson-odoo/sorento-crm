/**
 * The whole decision for one product, in the row that asks it (plan 4.4).
 *
 * Four zones on one strip: how the shortage is covered, what it costs and from whom, the
 * AutoCount level and quantity to key back, and whether the product should still be sold.
 * They used to be five separate cells with five separate popovers, each writing to the
 * backend the moment it closed - so a buyer changing their mind produced four requests and
 * the row's own numbers moved under them mid-thought.
 *
 * Every control calls `onEdit`, which lands in the page's draft map; the pill turns
 * Unsaved. The toolbar's Save (N) persists every drafted row at once; `onSave` (S12,
 * round 2, 9 Sep - was "Use suggestion", which reset the draft to the engine's own
 * mixture) persists just THIS row's draft the moment the buyer is done with it, without
 * waiting on the rest of the plan. The per-location stock table that used to live here
 * moved into the On hand lightbox (R12) and SPO is stated as a fact rather than offered as
 * an input (R2) - it is already inside the net, so a "take SPO" quantity would count it
 * twice.
