/**
 * The auto-collect setting reaches the FE (r9 S3/D10, AC-S3-7).
 *
 * LESSONS: a new settings column reaches the frontend only if it is in the
 * MANUAL mapper too. `mapSettingsFromApi` in `layout.tsx` is that mapper, and a
 * column missing from it looks exactly like a backend that never saved the
 * value.
 *
 * The Phase 1 per-tab override (`readAutoCollectDaysOverride`) went with the
 * column landing, which is the point: a real answer of 0 ("the sweep is off")
 * is falsy, so a fallback consulted after the column exists would quietly
 * overwrite it.
