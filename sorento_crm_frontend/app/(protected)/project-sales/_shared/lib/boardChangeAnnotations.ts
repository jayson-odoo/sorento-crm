/**
 * What a re-uploaded sales-order book did to a line, said on the board cell that line sits in
 * (`PLAN-scm-cs-planning-uat.md` part 3, AC-P3-2 / AC-P3-3).
 *
 * The captain, 25 August 2026: "same page as fulfilment, with the change annotated" - and
 * structure, not a sentence. So a changed line reads as a small Was / Now table of three rows
 * (Qty, Date, Decision) and nothing else.
 *
 * TWO RULES THIS FILE EXISTS TO HOLD:
 *
 * 1. **The batch's own machinery never reaches the screen.** `replan` / `retire` / `accept`
 *    named a reaction the row took to itself, and agreeing with a verb executed nothing; they
 *    are retired with the rule table (Slice C,
 *    `documentation/plans/scm/PLAN-scm-change-management-one-engine.md`). What a planner reads
 *    instead is the SUGGESTION the engine composed - one sentence per component, Keep /
 *    Reduce / Release / Reallocate on what is held and Use own / Borrow / SPO / Buy for new
 *    quantity (AC-C1) - printed verbatim, plus a Decision row built from the line's HELD
 *    composition on the Was side and what Apply would post on the Now side, through the same
 *    `partsBreakdown` the Suggestion and Decision cards are built from.
 * 2. **A closed line still has to be visible.** It contributes nothing to the board any more -
 *    the book closed it - so it has no cell of its own, and dropping it would make two thirds
 *    of the fixture's change invisible. It is annotated on the surviving cell of the SAME
 *    product on the SAME sales order instead, and reads `Closed` in the Now column, which is
 *    where a planner is already looking to see what replaced it.
 *
 * Pure: no fetch, no clock, no React. The panel hands it the batch and the cells it is about
 * to render, and gets back the annotations keyed exactly as the matrix keys its cells.
