/**
 * The one rule about what the customer did, and the one place it is expressed.
 *
 * Both stamps can be set at once: somebody who asked for a lower price can still sign. Every
 * surface has to reach the SAME answer about that document - the counter-sign page, the
 * Signatures badge, the banner on the document and the Status column of the project's quotation
 * list - so the ranking lives here and is read, never re-derived from the two dates.
