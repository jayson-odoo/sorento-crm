 * The trail for a screen the sidebar does not name.

 * Everything under `/project-sales/[projectId]` is a record inside a project,
 * and the sidebar stops at Projects. Derived from the pathname alone the trail
 * would collapse to "Dashboards > Sales Order", which says neither which
 * project nor how to get back to it, so these pages pass their own.
 *
 * The wording matches the sidebar's, per S5-02: the group is "Project Sales"
 * and its page is "Projects". The project's own crumb reads "Project" rather
 * than an id, because no UUID renders in the UI and the project's name is not
 * known to the server component that draws the header.
