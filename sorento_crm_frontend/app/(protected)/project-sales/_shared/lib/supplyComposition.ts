/**
 * The line balance CS is editing against, and everything that stops a Confirm.
 *
 * Pure on purpose: the sheet reads these on every keystroke, and the same rules are
 * rechecked by the server against authoritative facts at confirmation (plan 3.1 step 5).
 * The browser copy exists to say WHICH line is wrong before the round trip, never to be
 * the authority - a line that passes here can still fail there, and the failure names the
 * line by number and item code.
 *
 * Quantities travel as decimal strings (a float round trip loses the tail of a quantity
 * the customer signed for). Comparison is done in minor units at four decimal places,
 * which is the widest UOM precision the plan allows, so `10.1 + 20.2 === 30.3` reads as
 * balanced rather than as 0.0000000000000004 over.
