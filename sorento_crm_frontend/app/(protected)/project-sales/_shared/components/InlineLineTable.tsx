/**
 * Lines as a spreadsheet, not as a form behind a button.

 * line" puts an empty row at the bottom and the caret in its first cell, every cell is
 * edited where it sits, Tab walks across and rolls onto the next row, Enter drops down a
 * row, Escape puts one cell back. Adding four lines costs four rows of typing instead of
 * four rounds of open-fill-submit-reopen.
 *
 * WHY NOT THE SHARED `DataGrid`: three of its guarantees are the opposite of what an
 * editor wants. It holds skeleton rows until the column-preferences query settles, which
 * for a sub-table inside a detail page means the lines flash before they arrive; its cell
 * contract is `truncate` + `title`, which is right for reading a listing and wrong for a
 * cell that has to give its whole width to an input; and with no rows it replaces the
 * header with an empty message, while the ask here is that the header and the add row
 * survive an empty table. It also has nowhere to put an UNSAVED draft row, which is the
 * whole trick. So the table below is written out, without `table-fixed`, sized by explicit
 * per-column widths inside an `overflow-x-auto` box so a wide line table scrolls in its
 * own gutter and the page never moves sideways at 375px. It also renders a row that SPANS
 * every column (`band`), which a column-driven grid has nowhere to put.
 *
 * WHEN A ROW SAVES: when focus leaves it, for a row that is dirty and valid. That is the
 * Odoo rule and it needs no button. There is a button anyway, one tick per dirty row,
 * because a phone has no Tab key and tapping between cells of the same row would otherwise
 * never save anything.
 *
 * Saving goes through whatever the call site passes as `onCreate` / `onUpdate`, one row at
 * a time, which is what the per-line endpoints already do.
