/**
 * The decision on one contributing line, taken IN THE ROW (PLAN section 3.C, ruling R7).
 *
 * It used to be a modal over a modal: the row carried Approve / Amend / Reject buttons, and
 * Amend opened `BoardAmendDialog` on top of the breakdown dialog that opened it. Two stacked
 * dialogs put the line the planner is deciding on behind the thing they decide it with, and
 * the row's own facts - what was ordered, what is already delivered, what each location can
 * actually give - were on the layer underneath. So the row expands instead, the same gesture
 * reorder planning's group rows already use, and everything about the decision is in one
 * window with the numbers it is made against.
 *
 * It composes on the SAME `DraftLine` the per-order sheet and the old dialog composed on,
 * against the same `lineBalance` and `lineBlockers` - the sheet and the board have to agree
 * about what balances, or one screen refuses what the other accepted.
 *
 * TWO VERBS, and they are the whole decision: Save (take what is in these inputs) and Reject
 * (take none of it, with a reason). Save used to be two buttons - Approve suggestion beside
 * Save amendment - and the captain, on 28 August: "having 1 button save amendment for me to
 * click when an amendment is needed, and another button Approve when an amendment is not
 * needed, is too much of a work for me to think ... if the suggestion is same as decision then
 * it is approved, if suggestion different from decision then it is amended, so I just click on
 * 1 button". So the COMPARISON takes the verdict, not the planner: a form still holding the
 * engine's composition is approved, and one holding anything else is amended.
 *
 * NO BALANCE EQUATION (R9). The line "24 outstanding = 0 incoming + 9 reserve + ..." restated
 * four inputs the planner had just typed. What they cannot see is whether it ADDS UP, so that
 * is all that is said, as "4 short" or "4 over", and only while it does not.
