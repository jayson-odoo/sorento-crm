 * Owner feedback, 13 September 2026: the inline Was / Now block this component used to draw
 * on every changed cell was "abit too big", and the list view - the reading a planner
 * actually lives in - could not stay one line tall with a table inside it. So the cell and
 * the row now carry the same warning triangle a Rejected verdict carries, and the detail
 * moves behind a click: "just show whatever changed", as `x -> y`, and nothing else.
 *
 * The icon is the SAME in the grid and in the list, and the dialog is the same component in
 * both, so the two readings of the board cannot come to say different things about one
 * change.

 * What changed, and what the engine suggests about it - the lightbox's whole body.
 *
 * Only the fields that MOVED, as the WAS / NOW table (AC-D1, owner finding 22 Sep 2026: the
 * `label from -> to` lines this used to print read worse than the Order Inquiries box does).
 * The two sides sit in their own columns, so a reader compares down a column instead of
 * parsing an arrow; a field that did not move gets no row at all (`onlyMovedFields`, which
 * ONLY this lightbox asks for), and a row of dashes is not information. A change that moved
 * nothing at all says so in words rather than drawing an empty box (SF-3).
 *
 * A GROUP of changes (AC-D5) stacks one BLOCK per change, NEWEST FIRST - the caller reads a
 * batch oldest first, and the change a planner is answering is the last one to have
 * happened. Each block is that change's own table AND its own facts: the product it used to
 * be, where its held share went, how late it lands, what has physically moved already
 * (SF-4, captain's ruling: no silent loss - reading those off the newest change alone
 * dropped the older change's facts off the screen with nothing to say they existed). A
 * hairline rule separates the blocks. No heading over them: neither `BoardChangeAnnotation`
 * nor the batch ROW behind it carries a timestamp of its own (only the batch does), and a
 * date invented here would be a fact about nothing.
 *
 * The composed suggestion comes LAST, VERBATIM, and off the NEWEST change alone: the
 * sentence is server-composed because only the engine knows which rung covered what, against
 * which document, for whose order, and re-phrasing it here could only drift from what
 * Confirm will post - and an older row's suggestion has already been superseded by the
 * newest one, so printing both would offer a planner two answers to one question.
 *
 * The shortfall has no line of its own any more (AC-C11): the engine's own label already
 * reads "Short 44 by 22 Aug (was Buy 134)", and a bare "Short 44" beside it was the same
 * fact said twice, the second time with less in it.
