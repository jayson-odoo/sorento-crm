/**
 * Suggested vs decided, per kind of supply, across the whole selection (AC-D2).
 *
 * Six cards in one fixed order (`ORDER`), each carrying two figures. Numbers only: what a card
 * means is its label and its colour, both of which the legend directly above already states,
 * and a sentence under a card would be a feature explanation in the UI.
 *
 * A card whose two figures disagree carries the amber dot the board already uses for "this
 * moved". Pressing a card filters BOTH views to the lines carrying that kind on either side,
 * so "who bought what the pool could have covered" is two clicks rather than a scan.
 *
 * A card reading 0 and 0 is DISABLED rather than hidden: nothing on this board is that kind
 * of supply, so there is nothing to filter to, and a press that produced an empty board would
 * read as a broken filter. It keeps its place, because a card that came and went would move
 * every card beside it and the strip is read by glancing at a position.
