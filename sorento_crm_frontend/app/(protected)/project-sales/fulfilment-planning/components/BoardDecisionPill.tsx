/**
 * How far one line has got, in one word (R6).
 *
 * ONE pill for both readings of the board - the cell breakdown's contributing-lines table and
 * the list view - because they are two views of one draft and a reader toggles between them
 * to find the same line. Two pills that merely resembled each other would drift the first
 * time either changed.
 *
 * STATUS ONLY. It used to print the whole composition ("Reserve 20 BRW-BB · Borrow 10 · Buy
 * 13") and, on a confirmed line, the revision number as well - a sentence in a fixed-width
 * cell, truncated at the term that mattered. The composition is in the expanded row and on
 * the Sourced from column beside it; what the cell is scanned for is how far the line has got.
 *
 * SAVED, NOT APPROVED/AMENDED (S4, R-F, markup 2 Sep): once a decision has been SAVED - here,
 * on another device, or by another planner - the pill reads the plain word "Saved" rather
 * than which of the two verbs produced it. Approved vs amended is a fact for the expanded
 * row, which already shows the composition; the cell answers "has this been dealt with",
 * and "Saved" answers it in one word the same way "Suggested" and "Confirmed" do. A
 * REJECTED decision keeps its own label - it commits nothing, and "Saved" would say the
 * opposite of what happened to it.
