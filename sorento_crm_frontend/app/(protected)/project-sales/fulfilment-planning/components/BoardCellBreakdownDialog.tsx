/**
 * The breakdown behind one cell, and the decision on it (PLAN 13, journey step 4).
 *
 * A TABLE on the shared DataGrid, and the captain's reason for it is the whole design: "this
 * needs to be more table based instead of card based, so it is easier to see, and you need to
 * show me the SO order quantity, outstanding quantity also in the table ... then need to
 * show summary row whenever relevant". Ten lines as ten cards is a scroll; ten lines as ten rows
 * is a comparison, which is what a planner is actually doing here.
 *
 * The earlier version of this file argued for cards on the grounds that a row carries a
 * two-line explanation and a balance line. That argument does not survive the ask: the
 * per-row reasoning lives in the `title` of the cell that shows the composition, which is the
 * same `truncate` + `title` contract every other grid in this repo uses for long text.
 *
 * ONE VOCABULARY: what is still to go out is **outstanding**, everywhere on this screen. It
 * used to be "owed" in a column header, in a balance equation at the top and in a column of
 * the stock table, while the sales-order screens next door said "outstanding" for the same
 * figure - and a reader cannot tell a deliberate distinction from an accidental one.
 *
 * Approve / amend / reject are a ROW ACTION, and they write into the board's DRAFT, not into
 * the database (13.4): the decision that is persisted is still the whole sales order's, and the
 * order is what commits. Nothing here claims a cell committed anything.
 *
 * LAYOUT IS LOad-BEARING. The dialog is a flex column with its own max height; the body is the
 * only scrolling region and the footer is its SIBLING. Measured before the fix: at a 560px-tall
 * window the footer painted over the row's Approve button, so `document.elementFromPoint` at the
 * button's own centre returned the footer, and a planner on a laptop could not decide anything
 * at all. A modal whose action is unreachable is a modal that does not work (PRINCIPLES:
 * "modals are scrollable so the submit button is reachable").
