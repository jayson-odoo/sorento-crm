/**
 * What a planner can do about ONE line without leaving the row it is on
 * (`board-verdict-actions-chips-acceptance-criteria.md` section B, owner finding 22 Sep 2026
 * on SO402757: a "Change proposed" row offered no accept and no reject at all, so answering
 * the book meant opening every row in turn).
 *
 * ONE component for both readings of the board (AC-B11) - the list view's Verdict column and
 * the cell breakdown's Decision column - because they are two views of one draft and a
 * planner toggles between them to act on the same line. Two sets of icons that merely
 * resembled each other would drift the first time either changed.
 *
 * WHICH buttons show is read off `verdictOf` (`BoardDecisionPill`), never a second derivation
 * beside it: the pill and the buttons answer the same question ("how far has this line got"),
 * and a line whose pill says `Suggestion changed` must not be offered a quick Save of a
 * suggestion the engine has since withdrawn.
 *
 * THE REJECT POPOVER'S STATE LIVES HERE, not in a child of the branch that renders it
 * (BL-1, reviewer, fix round 2). `FulfilmentBoardPanel.decide` is local-first: it writes the
 * session draft SYNCHRONOUSLY, awaits the network, and reverts the key when the write fails.
 * So pressing Reject flips this line's verdict to `rejected` before `onDecide` has resolved,
 * which stops it being a "proposed" line - and a popover mounted inside that condition would
 * unmount mid-write, taking the typed reason with it, then come back blank when the revert
 * lands. This component's own identity survives the flip (the cell is re-rendered, never
 * remounted), so the reason does too.
