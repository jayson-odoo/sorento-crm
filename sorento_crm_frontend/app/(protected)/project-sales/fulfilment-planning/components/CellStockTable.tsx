 * The incoming legs were in a tooltip once, and they are SPO rows in the row's own expansion

 * NOT a DataGrid, and this is the carve-out `FulfilmentBoardMatrix` documents and PLAN 13.10
 * states: this is a fixed matrix of eight named figures, not a listing - no column config, sort,
 * resize or pagination applies to it, and its expansion is the point rather than a row action.
 * The three obligations of that carve-out are met here as they are there: the table scrolls
 * INSIDE its own container so the dialog never scrolls sideways, it is `w-full` with a min-width
 * FLOOR per column and the Location column taking the slack (never `table-fixed`, which overlaps
 * its columns the moment content exceeds the declared width), and long text truncates with a
 * `title`.
 *
 * A LOCATION WITH NO STOCK ROW READS 0 (AC-B2). It used to read "Not stated", and that was the
 * answer to a different question: an absent `stock` row means the last upload counted none
 * there, which is a fact, while "nobody has said where to look" is true only of a line whose
 * sales order names no location at all. That one row keeps its blanks, and it is now the only
 * row that can have any - the server states a figure for every location it names.
