 * match". The backend resolver already knows this (`_code_candidates`: the code plus every
 * dash-suffix of it), and the shortest suffix still worth searching is the one to seed with,
 * because a search is a substring match and the shortest candidate casts the widest net.
 * Four characters is the same floor the backend's own fuzzy probe uses, and it is what keeps
 * the trailing `-RL` of `BUI-HB-SRTWC8613-RL` from being mistaken for the code.
