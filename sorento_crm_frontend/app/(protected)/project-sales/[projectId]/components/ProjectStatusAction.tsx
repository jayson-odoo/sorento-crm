 * whichever row Postgres happened to return first. On a Registered project that was "Back to
 * identified" - the header offered undoing the registration as the obvious next step, with
 * "Spec in" demoted into the gear menu.
 *
 * Ranking on the TARGET rung's position needs no new data and cannot be got wrong by an
 * admin who leaves sort orders at zero. Backward moves are real and stay available, behind
 * the gear with the exits, because a correction should be deliberate.
 *
 * A funnel whose only remaining moves are terminal or backward still gets a primary button:
 * "there is a next step but we are hiding it" is worse than naming the exit.

 * graph editor gets its own moves, and a rung with no outgoing edge offers no action at
 * all rather than a button the server would reject.
