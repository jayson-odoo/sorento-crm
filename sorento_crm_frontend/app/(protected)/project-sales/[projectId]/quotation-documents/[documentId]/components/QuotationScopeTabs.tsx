/**
 * The scope switcher, read as a spreadsheet's sheet tabs: the names in a strip, and the way to
 * add one sitting at the END of that strip rather than as a page action across the screen.
 *
 * The client drew an arrow from the tabs to the far-right "Add a scope" button to make the point:
 * adding a scope is a tab-strip control, the same gesture as adding a sheet in Excel, so it
 * belongs where the tabs are and nowhere else.
 *
 * Money stays OFF the tab labels. The original reason still holds - "this is too much information
 * fatigue la, you can have a $ icon there where on click it shows the amount, but i don't want to
 * show the money and the scope tgt" - so a tab reads as a name and nothing more until the reader
 * asks. What changed is WHERE the asking happens: one $ per tab, answering for that tab in a
 * popover, instead of a single switch that printed the whole row of figures at once.
 *
 * The figure is always the server's own `scope_total`, formatted by the repo's decimal-exact money
 * helper. Never a second arithmetic in the browser, and never `parseFloat` on a money string.
