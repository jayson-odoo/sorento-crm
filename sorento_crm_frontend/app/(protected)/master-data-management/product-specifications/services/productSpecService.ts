/**
 * ============================================================================
 * API CONTRACT - the editable spec table (PR 2) and extraction from text (PR 4)
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Written out here because the frontend was built against it before any of it
 * existed (Phase 1), and because milestone 2's supplier portal renders the same
 * components against a different principal and has to match it.
 *
 * READS
 *
 *   GET /api/v1/master-data/product-specifications/by-product/{productId}
 *     -> ProductSpecDetail. `spec.values` is the table's row set; `spec.provenance`
 *        stamps each row with its source. A removed key appears ONLY in
 *        `provenance`, as `{source: 'human', absent: true}` with no entry in
 *        `values` - that tombstone is what stops re-derivation refilling it, and
 *        the table deliberately renders no row for it (removed means gone). The
 *        add picker offers it again; setting a value replaces the stamp.
 *     -> `exceptions[]` carries `reason: 'human_override_conflict'` with
 *        `proposed` = what the rules now read. Answered by SETTING THE VALUE;
 *        there is no resolve endpoint and there is not meant to be one (D9).
 *     -> `verification` is the VerificationBlock for the code (state, who vouched for
 *        it and when, and the was/now diff when its values moved under the stamp), and
 *        `values_hash` is the hash of the values on screen. Both ride this response so
 *        the Specifications tab needs no second round trip and both company copies of a
 *        code read the same badge (AC-D.14). The hash is echoed back on verify, which
 *        is what makes the same-transaction guard apply from the tab (AC-D.4). The
 *        verify / unverify routes themselves live in
 *        `spec-verification/services/specVerificationService.ts`.
 *
 *   GET /api/v1/master-data/spec-registry
 *     -> { keys: SpecRegistryKey[] }, vocabulary already merged.
 *
 *   GET /api/v1/master-data/spec-registry/applicable-keys?code={productCode}
 *     -> { code, keys: [{ spec_key, label, data_type, unit, allowed_values,
 *          synonyms, applicable, held }] }
 *        `applicable` mirrors derivation's `applies_when` gate; `held` is "has a
 *        value" and nothing else, so a REMOVED key is reported not held - its
 *        tombstone stays in `provenance` so re-derivation will not refill it, but
 *        the add picker offers it again and setting a value replaces the stamp.
 *        The code is matched case-insensitively. 404 on an unknown code -
 *        deliberately not an empty list, which would read as "this product may
 *        carry nothing".
 *
 *   GET /api/v1/master-data/spec-registry/similar?label={label}
 *     -> { label, match: { spec_key, label, matched_on, matched_text } | null }
 *        `matched_on` is one of spec_key | label | synonym.
 *
 * WRITES
 *
 *   PUT    .../by-product/{productId}/values/{specKey}   body { value }
 *   DELETE .../by-product/{productId}/values/{specKey}?mode=absent|revert
 *     `absent` = "this product does not have this spec", survives re-derivation.
 *     `revert` = hand the key back to the rules.
 *
 *   POST  /api/v1/master-data/spec-registry                   (create a key)
 *   POST  /api/v1/master-data/spec-registry/{specKey}/values  body { value }
 *     ONE word, appended server-side under a row lock. The PATCH below REPLACES
 *     `user_values`, so sending a list rebuilt from a cached read deletes whatever
 *     somebody else added in between; this route never takes the list from a client.
 *   PATCH /api/v1/master-data/spec-registry/{specKey}         (the registry editor,
 *     which shows the whole list and submits the whole list)
 *
 * THE 422 THAT IS NOT AN ERROR ENVELOPE
 *
 * The writes above refuse a near-duplicate with a TOP-LEVEL body, not the
 * AppException envelope, because the client has to render WHICH existing thing it
 * collided with:
 *
 *     422 { error: string, match: {...} }
 *
 * `POST .../{specKey}/values` refuses one more case the same way: a word an
 * administrator SUPPRESSED on the key comes back as `match.matched_on:
 * 'suppressed_value'`, since it is absent from the merged vocabulary and adding it
 * here would overturn a decision made on the key itself.
 *
 * There is no way past it: a colliding word is refused, full stop. `extractApiError`
 * cannot read this body - it is string-only - so these calls parse it themselves and
 * throw a `SpecSimilarError` carrying the sentence that names the collision.
 *
 * EXTRACTION FROM PASTED TEXT (PR 4)
 *
 *   POST .../by-product/{productId}/extract              body { text: string }
 *     -> { product_code: string,
 *          engine: 'semantic' | 'deterministic',
 *          model: string | null,
 *          proposals: SpecProposal[],
 *          unchanged: number }
 *        Gated on `master_data.products.edit`, not on any spec_registry grant.
 *        WRITES NO SPECIFICATION DATA (AC-B.1, B.2): the pasted text reaches the
 *        request body and goes no further, so the flyer row count and the spec
 *        `updated_at` are unchanged across a call. There is no "save the text"
 *        anywhere. The one row a call can write is an AI usage-log row, and only when
 *        a model answered - the same bookkeeping every other model call books against
 *        itself, telemetry about the call rather than a claim about the product.
 *        `kind` on each proposal is decided SERVER-SIDE (AC-B.3), never here, because
 *        milestone 2's supplier review reads the same field off a different endpoint
 *        and two copies of the rule would drift: stored key absent -> `new`; stored
 *        equal after coercion -> OMITTED entirely and counted in `unchanged`; stored
 *        authored or tombstoned -> `conflict`; stored non-authored and different ->
 *        `change`, except a size key (the description-first set), which is a
 *        `conflict` on the key alone - provenance does not record which text a stored
 *        value was read from. One proposal per key.
 *        `engine: 'deterministic'` means no model was reachable and the rules alone
 *        read it - a 200 marked as such, never a 502 (AC-B.5).
 *        422 { detail } with a readable message when the text is blank or longer than
 *        8,000 characters. Never truncated.
 *
 *   POST .../by-product/{productId}/values/batch
 *     body { entries: [{ spec_key: string, value: SpecProposalValue,
 *                        unit?: string | null, evidence: string }] }
 *     -> { product_code: string, rows_written: number, spec_keys: string[] }
 *        `value` is the proposal's value UNCHANGED, a list included: a multi-value key
 *        (a two-tone finish) is coerced element-wise and stored as the list, so it
 *        stores what a re-derivation of the same words would.
 *        1..50 entries; an empty list is a 422. So is a `spec_key` over 100 characters,
 *        an `evidence` over 500, and the same `spec_key` twice in one batch - one key
 *        twice is two claims about one thing, and the second would silently win.
 *        ONE call through `apply_spec_values`
 *        with `source: 'human'` and evidence `read from text: <evidence>` (AC-B.9):
 *        N per-key calls would produce N fan-outs, N rendered-text rebuilds and N
 *        verification diffs for one user action. Atomic - one bad entry fails the
 *        whole batch through the choke point's own validation, so the table is never
 *        left half-applied.
 *
 * RETIRED WITH PR 4
 *
 * `PUT .../by-product/{id}/flyer-text`, the `flyer_text` field on the by-product
 * response and the four `/findability/*` routes are gone, together, in the deploy
 * that promotes flyer provenance to authored (AC-B.12, B.14). The flyer stops being
 * something derivation reads; it reaches the specs only as proposals a person accepts
 * through the two routes above.
