# UAC: order sheet fixes, OI worksheet for a plan run, async OI export

Plan: `PLAN-order-sheet-oi-reports-22sep.md`. Status: DRAFT, rulings R1-R4 applied 22 Sep.

## Lane A - order sheet cells

- AC-A1 BRW incoming qty prints the total, then one `<container> - <qty>` line per open SPO
  line; a line with no container prints `<qty>`; no SPO number anywhere in the cell. Same
  on the low stock report's two sheets.
- AC-A2 Last in qty prints `<container> - <qty>` (or `<qty>` with no container); no SPO
  number. Last in date unchanged.
- AC-A3 BRW PO qty is unchanged (total, then `<PO number> - <qty>` lines).
- AC-A4 Project / customer prints `project_customer_label(customer, coalesce(project
  title, SO project label))`, one line per label with its qty. An adopted AutoCount SO with
  a project label prints `CUSTOMER / LABEL`, never the customer alone.
- AC-A5 Project qty, Delivery and Project / customer are built from the OI rows the
  engine buys for, in the run's scope only: verb ORDER or ORDER_BACK, state raised or
  partly_linked, ack acknowledged or changed, not redirected, owed (qty minus linked) > 0
  and printed as owed; SO in the run's picked orders when set, product in the run's
  products when set, delivery inside the run's window (undated included). Supply
  decisions play no part. A placed, actioned, awaiting-ack, rejected, redirected or fully
  linked row is absent.
- AC-A6 On a Project run with buy-in-full, Project qty equals Suggested qty on every row;
  a row of the same product due outside the window, or on an un-picked SO, is absent from
  all three cells.
- AC-A6b Suggestion prints one part per line, `Stock: 438`, `PO: 11`, `Buy: 67`, in that
  order, omitting zero parts; `Nothing` when there is no buy. On the PDF the cell renders
  the line breaks (pre-line class). The plan grid is unchanged.
- AC-A8b A test seeds a PO header in a currency other than MYR with a NULL-currency line
  and asserts that currency prints (a literal default cannot pass).
- AC-A5b A `write_rows`-level test pins the window: a picked-SO row dated after the run's
  `plan_horizon_date` is absent from the frozen `project_customers`.
- AC-A10 Company isolation: a second company's PO line and OI row are excluded from Last
  cost and Project qty respectively; the order sheet worker fails closed (no rows, no
  costs) for a run row carrying no company.
- AC-A7 New column "Last cost" sits immediately right of Supplier on the XLSX and the PDF;
  every later column keeps its own width and wrap/number rule.
- AC-A8 Last cost = the newest non-cancelled PO line's unit cost with its currency, the
  line's own when set else the PO header's; never a literal default. Blank when the
  product has no PO line with a cost. Looked up at export time. Test: a line with NULL
  currency on a MYR header prints `x.xx MYR`.
- AC-A9 Supplier still names the last-purchase supplier (regression pin).

## Lane B - async OI export

- AC-B1 Export Excel on the OI detail returns at once with a toast; a `user_downloads` row
  exists with kind `order_inquiry_xlsx`, source `order_inquiry` + the OI id, filename
  `<OI number>.xlsx`.
- AC-B2 The worker renders the same workbook the sync export produced (same sheets, same
  rows, same headings) and the row goes ready; My Downloads lists it.
- AC-B3 A second click while one is queued or processing starts nothing (toast says so).
- AC-B4 Enqueue failure marks the row failed with the reason; the drawer shows it.
- AC-B5 The OI detail gear has "Download history"; it lists only this OI's downloads,
  newest first, and opens the ready file.
- AC-B6 The OI list page's Export Excel also queues a download (kind
  `order_inquiry_worklist_xlsx`, no source entity, current filters honoured) and toasts;
  the file matches the old sync GET for the same filters.
- AC-B7 Permission: the same VIEW permission the sync export required.

## Lane C - OI worksheet for a plan run

- AC-C1 The plan view's export menu shows "OI worksheet Excel" beside the order sheet and
  low stock items; all four disable while any export is pending.
- AC-C2 Clicking queues a download tied to the run (`reorder_run`, run id), kind
  `oi_worksheet_xlsx`, filename `oi-worksheet-<ddmmyyyy>.xlsx`, and toasts.
- AC-C3 The workbook is the worklist export's layout: title ORDER INQUIRY, headings SO DATE
  / S/O NO / ITEM CODE / QTY / TOTAL QTY / DELIVERY DATE / PROJECT/CUSTOMER / SUPPLIER / PO
  NO / LOCATION (no ACKNOWLEDGED), one sheet per delivery month, NO DATE sheet for undated
  rows, rows ordered SUPPLIER then ITEM CODE, TOTAL QTY on the last row of an item.
- AC-C4 Row set = every live OI Buy row inside the run's Start Plan scope: the run's SO
  numbers when set, its product ids when set, and delivery date inside the run's window
  (undated included). A row outside the window, for an SO not in the list, or for a
  product not in the list, is absent. A row whose product the engine did NOT put on the
  sheet is still present when it is in scope.
- AC-C4a The workbook's rows are exactly the rows Project qty counted on the same run (one helper).
- AC-C4b The count of OI headers and rows in the workbook equals what the Start Plan
  picker showed for the same selection (raised date, delivery window, orders, products).
- AC-C5 A run with no rows produces a one-sheet workbook with the headings only.
- AC-C6 The cap follows the worklist export's own cap; over it the route refuses with
  "Narrow the plan first" before creating a download row.

## Lane D - plan All with picked project SOs

- AC-D1 Start Plan with Demand = All shows the Orders picker (the shared
  `SearchableMultiSelect`), pre-ticked with every candidate order that has rows in the
  range; the buyer can untick. The closed trigger is ONE line: the first two SO numbers
  then `+x` for the rest (`SO418869, SO419517 +12`); menu rows are one line each. Same
  trigger under Demand = Project. Not clipped at 375px.
- AC-D1b On an All run WITH picked orders the From / To range narrows only the project OI
  rows; a retail SO line due after the To date is still planned. On an All run with no
  picked orders, and on a Dealer or Project run, the range behaves as today (retail leg
  windowed); `test_reorder_window_start.py` stays green unchanged.
- AC-D2 The run request carries `so_numbers` with no `demand_class`; the run row stores
  both as sent.
- AC-D3 On that run, a product whose only project demand sits on an un-picked SO carries no
  project need; a picked SO's OI rows in window are bought in full on top of retail sizing.
- AC-D4 A retail-only product below its level is still admitted and sized as on today's
  All run; Dealer o/s on the sheet is unchanged.
- AC-D5 Project qty on the sheet and the OI worksheet both equal the picked SOs' rows in
  window for that run.
- AC-D6 Demand = Dealer shows no picker and behaves as today; Demand = Project behaves as
  PR #1122 left it.

## Lane E - discontinued product with confirmed OI demand

- AC-E1 A discontinued (active, not excluded) product with a confirmed OI Buy line inside the
  run's scope gets a plan line whose Project need equals the line's owed qty.
- AC-E2 The same product with its only OI line outside the window, on an un-picked SO, or
  awaiting ack gets no line.
- AC-E3 A discontinued product below its reorder level with no OI line gets no line on an
  All or Dealer run (leg 2 never admits it).
- AC-E4 On an All run the admitted discontinued product's Suggested qty is the project need
  only, even when it sits below its level; Retail contributes nothing.
- AC-E5 A Dealer run never admits a discontinued product.
- AC-E6 `is_active = false` or `exclude_from_planning = true` still keeps a product out,
  confirmed OI line or not.
- AC-E7 The product's line appears on the order sheet (Project qty) and the OI worksheet for
  that run.
## Lane F - confirmed OI need bought in full on an All run

- AC-F1 All run, product with on hand greater than its confirmed OI qty, retail trigger
  off: Suggested qty equals the OI owed qty; the row is visible (not covered).
- AC-F2 All run, same product with the retail trigger on: Suggested qty equals retail
  sizing plus the full OI qty.
- AC-F3 ORDER BACK on a closed, fully delivered SO line, confirmed: bought in full on an
  All run and on a Project run.
- AC-F4 A confirmed Reserve decision of R units on that row reduces the bought qty by R.
- AC-F5 Retail-only products and Dealer runs size exactly as before.
- AC-F6 The demand drill's Project figure, the order sheet's Project qty and the OI
  worksheet agree with the bought project qty on that run.
- AC-F7 Pool, single-member and product-grain paths all satisfy AC-F1.
