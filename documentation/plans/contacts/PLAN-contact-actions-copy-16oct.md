# PLAN: contacts list Actions dropdown + copy access copies everything (CONTACT-ACTIONS-COPY)

Status: in review (reviewer fix round + crew audit round applied) (small fix track: FE swap to an existing component + extend an existing copy service; no migration, no auth/RBAC change)

Owner, 16 Oct 2026: "also please put these all actions under 'Actions' dropdown just like other list view,
and when we copy, it doesn't copy things like brands, image access, voice note access, it doesn't copy all".

## 1. Actions dropdown
The contacts list bulk strip (`components/ContactsList.tsx`) renders the shared `BulkActionsMenu`
(`app/(protected)/scm/components/BulkActionsMenu.tsx`, already used by Purchase Orders and Ideas) through
`DataGridListToolbar.bulkActionsSlot`. Items come from the pure `lib/contactBulkActions.ts`: Export, Link
customers, Enable messaging, Sync from Respond, Copy access from contact, then the red items Disable
messaging and Delete, which still open their existing dialogs. "n selected" and Clear stay (toolbar).

## 2. Copy access copies every access setting
Copied (`app/services/contact_access_copy_service.py`), all through the one bulk-copy endpoint:

| Facet | Stored in | Since |
|---|---|---|
| Access types | `respond_contact_access_types` | 3 Oct |
| Tier | `respond_contacts.chatbot_profile.tier` (only that key) | 3 Oct |
| Stock checks, Notify salesman, Packing list, ETA buffer days, Escalation, AI replies, Skip date-range questions | `respond_contacts` booleans | 3 Oct onwards |
| Send files as links | `respond_contacts.chatbot_files_as_links` | **this lane** |
| Regions | `respond_contacts.regions` | CONTACT-REGION |
| Field reveals (incl. cost visibility) | `contact_field_reveals` | 3 Oct |
| Agent access | `contact_agent_access` (needs `access_agents.edit`) | 3 Oct |
| Agent field overrides | `agent_field_access` rows with `contact_id` set (part of Agent access, same permission and skip) | **this lane** (crew audit) |
| Requires registered project | `respond_contacts.requires_registered_project` | **this lane** (crew audit) |
| Stock check mode + locations | `stock_visibility_policies` contact row (needs `inventory.stock.edit`) | 4 Oct |
| Companies | `respond_contact_companies` (superadmin/admin) | 4 Oct |
| Market segments | `respond_contact_market_segments` | 4 Oct |
| Brands | `respond_contacts.brand_ids` (empty = every brand, shown "All brands") | **this lane** |
| Image access | `contact_media_limit` (image: on/off, monthly limit) | **this lane** |
| Voice note access | `contact_media_limit` (voice: on/off, monthly limit, max clip seconds) | **this lane** |
| Attachment types | `contact_attachment_types` (grants on top of the baseline) | **this lane** |
| Portal forms | `contact_portal_form_overrides` (the contact's own on/off overrides; none = inherits) | **this lane** |
| Spec visibility | `spec_visibility_policies` contact row (none = inherits) | **this lane** |

Every new facet is edited directly under `user_management.contacts.edit` or less (attachment types only
need a signed-in user, a pre-existing gap noted on the PR), so the copy's own permission covers them. Brands
also follow the direct editor's company rule: a source brand outside the actor's company scope leaves the
facet out and names it under "Not copied". No media row, or an Off row with stale limits, reads as Off (the
gate fails closed).

Not copied (identity or the person's own state): name, phone, Respond.io id, portal slug, workspace,
linked customers, CS routing, memory level, chatbot language / ledgers / facts (rest of `chatbot_profile`),
outbound messaging switch (own bulk action), media usage counters and notice stamps, voice `languages` (no
editor writes it).
