# UAC: CONTACT-ACTIONS-COPY

- A1 With rows selected the contacts list shows "n selected", one "Actions" dropdown, and Clear. No loose bulk buttons.
- A2 Delete and Disable messaging are red items in the menu and still open their existing dialogs.
- A3 Without contacts.edit, Link customers and Copy access are not in the menu.
- B1 Copy access from a source with every access setting set lands every one of them on each target; identity untouched.
- B2 Image / voice note access: no row on the source turns the target Off; an Off row (whatever limits it kept) and no row are the same access; media already equal is not rewritten.
- B3 An empty brand list on the source clears the target's brand scope, shown as "All brands"; a source brand outside the actor's company scope is not copied and is listed under Not copied.
- B5 Inherited portal forms / spec visibility on the source clear the target's own overrides; attachment type grants are replaced.
- B4 The copy dialog's first step lists what will be copied (Brands, Image access, Voice note access included) and what is not, before Apply.
- B6 Per-contact agent field overrides are copied (replaced) with Agent access, and left alone with it (named under Not copied) for an actor without access_agents.edit. Requires registered project is copied.
