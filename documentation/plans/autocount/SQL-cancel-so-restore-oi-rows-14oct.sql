-- CANCEL-STOP-AT-SO, owner data repair, step 2 of 2: RESTORE. Owner only, in psql.
--
-- Puts back the order inquiry rows the AutoCount Cancel SO hook retired since 14 Oct 2026
-- 00:00 MYT (step 1, SQL-cancel-so-retired-oi-rows-14oct.sql, lists them; read it first).
-- Run ONLY after the CANCEL-STOP-AT-SO fix is deployed, or the next Cancel SO sync retires
-- them again.
--
-- What the retirement did to a row (ProjectOrderInquiryService.retire_rows_for_cancelled_lines):
--   state raised / partly_linked / placed -> cancelled; "; Transferred to Cancel SO: <XS no>"
--   appended to the note; any links removed (each appending "; Unlinked from <doc>" first);
--   suggested links dropped; one OI_ROW_CANCELLED audit row (cause cancel_so). Nothing else on
--   the row moved (qty, dates, verb, ack_state, po_ref / po_line_id untouched).
-- What this script restores, for a row it can restore exactly:
--   state -> raised (a row with no link is `raised`: INQUIRY_LINK_STATES), note -> the note
--   without the retirement's stamp (NULL when the stamp was the whole note); its inquiry header
--   reads raised again. Also rows on a line that has reopened since (cancel lowered / voided /
--   re-decided): those rows are live demand again.
-- What it does NOT restore (listed in 2, left for CS / purchasing by hand):
--   rows whose retirement removed links (were partly linked / placed: the link qty is not
--   recorded anywhere) and rows tagged to a PO (`po_line_id`, were placed).
-- Not restorable by any script: the "CANCEL ALL" emails already sent, and suggested links
-- (the next link suggestion pass proposes them again).
--
-- Shape: BEGIN, build the list, show it, update, verify, then STOP. Nothing is saved until the
-- owner reads the verify output and types COMMIT (or ROLLBACK). There is no COMMIT below.
-- Run it INTERACTIVELY (psql -f would end the session and roll the transaction back):
--   psql "$DATABASE_URL"
--   \i SQL-cancel-so-restore-oi-rows-14oct.sql
--   ... read the output, then type COMMIT; or ROLLBACK;
