# DO-HISTORY owner card (13 Oct 2026, v2 after your direction)

Plan: `PLAN-do-history-backfill-13oct.md`. Counts: prod clone `sorento_prod_20261012` (crew, read-only).

## Your direction, applied

1. **The backfill runs from the shared service's existing DocDate DO job.** The CRM script is dropped.
2. **The start is 2023-09-01**, set in the shared service. MCH's first SO in the CRM is also
   2023-09-01, so both books start inside the CRM's SO history.
3. **Only provable SO-line links.** The key link wins when present. Otherwise a link is made when
   the SO has exactly one line of that product. This rule made all 29,040 of today's links, and
   they stay. When several lines could match (about 13,259 today), the DO line links to the SO +
   product group and to no line, with no guessing (owner 14 Oct: no narrowing by location).
   AutoCount's API sends no line key (0 of 45,157 lines).

## Who does what

| Where | What |
| --- | --- |
| Crew (pending) | Find a line-key source for the ambiguous lines (DODTL via FXView, or an API wrapper change). |
| Shared service | Start floor 2023-01-01 -> 2023-09-01 (`doc_feed/constants.py:48`). DO feed rows for Sorento and Mocha. Run the existing DocDate backfill 2023-09-01 -> today, dry run on the prod clone first. |
| CRM (this PR) | Link by key, else unique product, else unique product at the same location. Otherwise unlinked. Mark pre-cutover DOs delivered as they land. Keep a backfill run out of the audit log and the embedding queue. |

## What you will see

| Before | After |
| --- | --- |
| AutoCount DOs only from Aug 2026 | AutoCount DOs from 1 Sep 2023 |
| A backfilled DO would read "New Order" (outstanding) | A DO before 1 Jul 2026 with no tracking reads **Delivered**, with the delivery date **left empty** and an "assumed" marker. It counts as delivered everywhere the DO delivered/outstanding rule is used |
| DO lines linked by key or a unique product match | Same, plus a unique match at the same location; several candidates stay unlinked |

Not changed:
- SO demand, OI, the planning board and emails (the DO import writes none of them).
- Lists filtered on "has a delivery date" do not show assumed DOs as dated.

Undo: one SQL statement resets every assumed DO to New Order (in the plan, section 4).

## Line keys (on hold, your decision)

AutoCount's API sends no SO line key on DO lines, and our read-only SQL login cannot read DO /
DODTL. Ambiguous lines (several SO lines of the same product, about 13,259 today) stay unlinked
until you decide where line keys come from.
