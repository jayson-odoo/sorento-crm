# PLAN: SPO-XLSX-SUPERSEDE (round 2) - Excel rows with no destination superseded by AutoCount split lines

Status: IN PROGRESS 2026-10-01, standard track (expected diff over 300 lines incl. tests; no migration; touches
receipts, so reviewer + security-reviewer). UAC: `spo-xlsx-product-fallback-acceptance-criteria.md` (same folder).
Parent: `PLAN-spo-xlsx-supersede.md` (D25..D30), this adds D31..D36.

## 0. Why (owner case, prod, 1 Oct 2026)

PL GCXU6137164, SRTWCX8605-S-RL-PJ: shipped 99, "SPO allocated" 194, received 95; SPO-2026/08-0074 all Fully
Received; chatbot "Incoming Quantity 4, BRW-IB (22), BRW-NTC (77)". Same for SRTWC8605-SC-RL (96 vs 191).

Verified on `757b41da2`:

- The Excel upload wrote one aggregate row per `(product, upper(location))` (`services/scm/outstanding_import_service.py`
  `_spo_line_plans`), here location `HQ` and no `warehouse_id`: rows of 95 (on the PL) and 4 (no PL).
- The first AutoCount push supersedes only within `supersede_group_key` (`services/rules/shipping_order_rules.py:355`,
  product + warehouse, else product + location). `(p, loc:HQ)` never meets `(p, wh:BRW-IB)` / `(p, wh:BRW-NTC)`, so
  `plan_xlsx_supersede` (`:477`) files the Excel group under `KEPT_NO_COUNTERPART` (`:540`) and the push closes it
  (`shipping_order_ingest_service.py:557`) without retiring it; R2 (`services/scm/spo_supply.py:74`) keeps a row with a
  receipt visible.
- GR-2026/09-0049 picks 22 (BRW-IB) + 73 (BRW-NTC) against the Excel 95 row and 4 against the Excel 4 row.
  `build_allocation_pool` (`services/grn_spo_matching.py:96`) does not skip closed or retired rows and is FIFO by
  `created_at`, so the older Excel rows are drawn first whenever they still show capacity.
- PL "SPO allocated" sums every visible allocation on the shipment (`api/v1/procurement/packing_lists.py:273`):
  99 AutoCount + 95 Excel = 194. PL "Received" is approved picking lines linked to allocations on the shipment
  (`procurement_service.py:1040`): 95, because the 4 hangs off the PL-less Excel row.
- Chatbot: `remaining = shipped - stored received` (`incoming_stock_service.py:67`), stored by
  `refresh_shipment_line_statuses` (`procurement_service.py:1135`) = 99 - 95 = 4; warehouse allocations
  (`_warehouse_allocations_for`, `:233`) sum `allocated_quantity` and ignore receipts, so BRW-IB 22 + BRW-NTC 77.

## 1. Decisions

| id | decision |
| --- | --- |
| D31 | **Product-level fallback pairing.** In `plan_xlsx_supersede`, after the keyed pass, the Excel rows still `no_counterpart` that carry NO `warehouse_id` are pooled per product, together with that product's incoming lines no keyed group claimed. The pool is superseded as one group when `sum(rows.allocated_quantity) == sum(lines.allocated_quantity)` (exact: there is no destination evidence, so the quantities are the only proof the two sides describe the same goods). Otherwise the rows stay `no_counterpart` exactly as before. A row that names a warehouse is never fallback-paired. |
| D32 | **Receipt links split by capacity on a fallback group.** The keyed path moves every picking line to the group's first line (all its lines share one destination and D28a redistributes within it). A fallback group's lines sit in DIFFERENT `(product, location)` groups, so its picking lines are moved with the GRN import's own rule (`grn_spo_matching.draw_fifo`): same warehouse first (`source_warehouse_id`, else `destination_warehouse_id`), then any, each line up to its allocated quantity less what already picks against it, an overflow onto the last line; a picking line spanning two targets is split into two rows (expected follows the split, the shortfall stays on the last chunk). Claims and order-inquiry links still move to the first line. The receipt carry (`distribute_received`) is unchanged. |
| D33 | **A superseded row that is not deleted is retired** (no `.delete` grant, D30). Closed as today, plus `retired_at` stamped and `quantity_received` zeroed (its receipt now lives on the replacement lines; the trail log and the `superseded by <DocKey> (received N carried)` note keep the old figure). Without this the row stayed visible (R2) and kept inflating PL "SPO allocated". |
| D34 | **Future GRs never land on a retired allocation.** `build_allocation_pool` skips `retired_at IS NOT NULL`. With D31..D33 a superseded Excel row is gone or retired, so the pool offers only the AutoCount lines. |
| D35 | **No false incoming on a received PL line.** `get_received_quantities_by_product` = per product `max(approved-pick total, sum(stated_received) of visible allocations on the shipment)`, so AutoCount's own statement that the lines arrived is never undercut by a pick hanging off another row. The chatbot's per-warehouse list shows only what is still to come per allocation (`allocated - max(received, stated)`, closed / fully received lines contribute 0) and drops warehouses at 0; the unallocated-gap arithmetic keeps the full allocated total. |
| D33a | **Conservation guard** (crew ruling 1 Oct; security review S2). Before any superseded row is deleted or zeroed, `assert_supersede_conserved` proves the planned carry equals what the rows held, the replacement lines state at least that, and no GRN pick of ANY company still points at them; otherwise the record fails (ingest) or the document is rolled back, named and counted as aborted (repair script, which also runs the pure half in dry-run). The zeroed figure is frozen into `stated_received` on the retired row (N1). |
| D35a | **Stated floor is capped and trusts the ingest principal** (security review S1). Each allocation contributes `least(stated_received, allocated_quantity)`. Consequence for the owner to note: the ESB's TransferedQty statement now decides PL receipt state alongside approved picks, so an inflated push can mark a container received (it could already mark the SPO line received under D26). |
| D36 | **Repair = the dedupe script, extended.** `scripts/dedupe_spo_xlsx_superseded.py` gets D31/D32 through the shared planner and the shared split repoint, stays DRY-RUN by default, and its summary adds the scope count (`shipments (PLs) touched`). Production apply is owner-gated. |

## 2. Not touched

The keyed supersede (D25..D30), the D26a guard, adoption, the Excel importer, PL page UI, the
`refresh_shipment_line_statuses` allocated total (AC-H17).

## 3. Slices

One slice, one PR. Red tests first on a fixture of exactly the owner case, kill-tested; then the code; reviewer +
security-reviewer (receipts are rewritten by the repair).
