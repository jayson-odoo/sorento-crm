-- DO-HISTORY Q3, option (a) (owner ruling 14 Oct 2026): the CRM writes nothing to the pre-July
-- open SO lines. The owner closes them in AutoCount; this is the list to work from.
--
-- READ-ONLY. The OWNER runs it on prod; no agent runs it there. It only SELECTs, inside a
-- READ ONLY transaction that is rolled back, so a mistyped edit fails instead of writing.
-- Export: run it in any SQL client and save the result grid as Excel / CSV, or in psql swap
-- the final SELECT for `\copy (<the SELECT>) to 'pre_july_open_so_lines.csv' csv header`.
--
-- Which lines:
--   * Every source. Most rows come from the AutoCount SO feed (`source = autocount`); a few
--     AutoCount-numbered SOs were loaded from an Excel upload before the feed (`scm_upload`,
--     e.g. SO245246). They are listed too, so the CRM is not left with open lines nobody saw;
--     look each one up in AutoCount by its SO no.
--   * SO dated before 2026-07-01 (the Order Tracking cutover, PLAN-do-history-backfill-13oct.md 1.1).
--   * Order and line both open, and something still to transfer: qty ordered > qty transferred.
-- "Qty transferred" is AutoCount's own SODTL TransferedQty, which the SO sync stores as
-- `sales_order_lines.qty_delivered` (app/models/order.py:728-731). It already counts Cancel SO
-- quantities, so "open qty" is the same figure AutoCount's outstanding SO listing shows.
--
-- Dev check (shared dev DB sorento_cagent_stack, read-only, 14 Oct 2026; that copy runs to SO
-- date 2026-09-21 and holds the SRT book only): 10,630 lines, 1,080,457 open qty; 10,566 of them
-- from the AutoCount feed, 64 (5,296 qty) from the upload. The plan's 9,615 lines (section 1.1)
-- is crew's count on the 12 Oct prod clone, by its own definition; the owner's run of query 1 is
-- the number that counts.
