# PLAN: lock the MCP endpoint + default-deny company scope

Status: in review, reviewer READY, security-reviewer should-fixes applied (full track, size M: auth change on the MCP server, no migration, no UI change)
UAC: `sec-mcp-auth-acceptance-criteria.md`
Lane: SEC-MCP-AUTH (owner D7, 16 Oct). Supersedes the unmerged PR #1548 (MCP-LOCKDOWN), whose
bearer gate and env name `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` this lane ports unchanged.

## Findings (verified at origin/main 3d837263)

### Who calls the MCP server

| Caller | How | File:line |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CRM backend: in-app AI assistant | `MCPRuntimeClient` at `settings.ai_assistant_mcp_url` | `sorento_crm_backend/app/services/ai_assistant_service.py:342`, `:758`, `:2064`, `:2334`, `:2451`, `:2978` |
| CRM backend: chatbot business lane (fetch + probes) | same client | `sorento_crm_backend/app/services/chatbot/lanes/business/services.py:272` |
| CRM backend: chatbot ideate lane | same client | `sorento_crm_backend/app/services/chatbot/lanes/ideate.py:127` |
| n8n `MCP Client` / `MCP Client1` nodes (sub-get-results, dormant since the chatbot moved into the CRM) | `http://<CRM_ORIGIN>:8765/mcp` | `documentation/runbooks/prod-edge-lockdown.md:81-84` |
| n8n heartbeat workflow (HA monitor) | httpRequest `tools/call crm_master_products_list` | `documentation/runbooks/n8n-heartbeat-workflow.json` (node "MCP call") |
| Release post-check | `curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp` | `.github/workflows/deploy.yml:2116-2123`, `.github/workflows/rollback.yml:175-181` |

`MCPRuntimeClient` is the only MCP client class in the backend, so one header change there covers
every in-repo caller.

Exposure: host nginx listens on 8765 and proxies to the live colour's container on loopback
(`scripts/blue_green_deploy.sh:5`, `:12-13`, `:444`). The provider firewall limits 8765 to the
n8n host and the box itself (`documentation/runbooks/prod-edge-lockdown.md:192-236`). The prod
compose file is server-only (not in the repo).

### Auth today

None. `sorento_crm_mcp/sorento_crm_mcp/__main__.py:27` serves FastMCP's app directly; nothing reads
an inbound header. The MCP server then calls the CRM with the shared `EXTERNAL_API_KEY`
(`sorento_crm_mcp/sorento_crm_mcp/http_client.py:56`), so any caller that reaches 8765 acts with
that key, write tools included (`record_actions.py`, `ideation.py`).

### Cross-company reads

The backend scope service, `sorento_crm_backend/app/services/company_scope_resolver.py:244-252`
(`_resolve_api_key_scope`): an X-API-Key call with no `contact_id` + `space_id` resolves to `None`,
which means every company. With both present it resolves through `resolve_contact_company_scope`
(`:221-241`), which is fail-closed (an unknown contact gets an empty set, so 0 rows).

So every MCP tool that declares `contact_id` + `space_id` (38 of 53 in `merged_catalog(CATALOG)`,
pinned by `sorento_crm_mcp/tests/test_company_scope_params.py:20-61`) returns all companies' rows
when the caller leaves the pair blank or out. The staff AI assistant blanks them on purpose
(`ai_assistant_service.py:2455`, `:2705-2706`, `:3070-3071`). `crm_lookup_resolve` documents the
same fallback for n8n (`sorento_crm_mcp/sorento_crm_mcp/server.py:115-122`).

The product-attachment fan-out inside `crm_master_products_list` (`server.py:1064-1098`) calls a
second scoped route without the pair, so its child rows are unscoped even on a scoped call.

Tools without the pair (the 15 others) read global data (`GLOBAL_TOOLS` in the test above:
forms, SLA, complaint analytics, tool capabilities), or are writes or Outline reads. Two are
company-owned with no contact param: `crm_project_forecast` (a whole-company aggregate by design,
`test_company_scope_params.py:44`) and `crm_purchase_request_by_number`. They are listed as a
follow-up, not changed here: there is no contact to scope them by.

## Design

### 1. Service auth (port of #1548)

- `sorento_crm_mcp/sorento_crm_mcp/auth.py`: ASGI gate. `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>`,
  `hmac.compare_digest`; anything else gets 401 with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`. `/healthz` is open
  so a container healthcheck needs no secret. Websockets are refused. The token is never logged.
- `MCP_AUTH_MODE`: `enforce` (default) or `permit`. In `permit`, a request with NO Authorization
  header passes and logs one warning line (method, path, no header values); a wrong token is
  still 401. It exists for one release so callers can move over without an outage, then the owner
  removes it.
- Fail closed: `create_http_app` refuses to start without a token of 32+ characters, in both
  modes.
- Backend: `MCPRuntimeClient` sends `Authorization: Bearer <settings.mcp_auth_token>` when set
  (`MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`, same value).

### 2. Default-deny scope

One check, `require_contact_scope(spec, query, body, request_headers)` in
`sorento_crm_mcp/sorento_crm_mcp/scope.py` (`check_scope`), called in the tool body `_compile_tool` generates,
right before `_execute_tool_request_with_body`: every catalog tool's call goes through it (GET and POST), and it is
the only place that holds the request context the staff header is read from. A tool is scoped when its
spec declares both `contact_id` and `space_id`, read from the catalog itself rather than a second
list. A scope id counts only as one non-blank string or integer (a list such as `[""]` is refused: httpx repeats it and
the backend reads the last, blank value). A scoped call with either value blank gets
`{"error": "scope_required", "data": [], "total": 0, ...}` and no backend request is made. The
contact to company resolution stays where it is (`resolve_contact_company_scope`); MCP only
refuses to ask without an identity.

The staff AI assistant opts out explicitly: `MCPRuntimeClient(..., staff=True)` sends
`X-MCP-Scope: staff`, set only at the AI assistant's own call sites. The chatbot lanes never set
it. This keeps today's assistant results (no behaviour change, owner question posted on the PR);
scoping the assistant to the staff user's active company is the follow-up. The header is honoured
only on an authenticated request; any caller holding the token already holds the key that reads
every company, so the opt-out grants nothing new.

The products fan-out forwards the caller's `contact_id` + `space_id` to its child call.

### 3. Callers that must send the token

- backend_blue, backend_green, worker, worker_fast: `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` (env).
- mcp_blue, mcp_green: `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `MCP_AUTH_MODE=permit` for the first release.
- n8n: the heartbeat workflow and the 6 dormant `MCP Client` nodes, Bearer credential (owner step).
- Release post-check: sends a deliberately wrong token and expects 401, which proves the gate is
  there in both modes (an ungated image answers 406). Then it makes the CRM's own `list_tools` call from inside the
  live backend container, which catches a backend holding a different token (401 in both modes).
  `rollback.yml` accepts 406 with a warning, since a rollback to a pre-gate image is still a working rollback.

## Rollout (owner runs every prod step)

1. Before dispatching the release: `openssl rand -hex 32`; put it in the prod `.env` as
   `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`. In the server compose add `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN: ${MCP_AUTH_TOKEN:?}` to the MCP env
   (`x-mcp-env`) and to backend_blue, backend_green, worker, worker_fast; add `MCP_AUTH_MODE: permit`
   to the MCP env only. Confirm the MCP container healthcheck in the server compose: if it calls `/mcp`, point it
   at `/healthz` now (otherwise it turns unhealthy once enforce is on and the NEXT release aborts at the health wait).
2. Dispatch the release. During the colour swap the old backend sends no token; `permit` lets it
   through, so the chatbot never sees a 401.
3. n8n: credential Bearer Auth `sorento-mcp-bearer` with the token; attach it to the heartbeat
   "MCP call" node and to the 6 `MCP Client` nodes (re-import the heartbeat JSON from this PR, it
   also switches to a global tool, see UAC).
4. After a day with no `unauthenticated MCP request allowed (permit mode)` line in the MCP logs
   (`docker compose logs mcp_<colour> | grep 'permit mode'`): remove `MCP_AUTH_MODE` from the
   compose and recreate the MCP container (env-only, no release). Enforce is now on.

Rollback: an image from before this PR removes the gate. The firewall rule on 8765 stays the
outer guard either way.

## Shared token (security review, 16 Oct)

n8n and the CRM backend share one `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`, so any holder can send `X-MCP-Scope: staff` and read every
company on scoped tools. That grants nothing new: n8n already holds `EXTERNAL_API_KEY`, which reads every company
straight from the backend. Not a blocker. A backend-only token that alone unlocks the staff header is a follow-up,
triggered by n8n losing `EXTERNAL_API_KEY` or by the assistant-scoping follow-up, whichever comes first.

## Follow-ups (not this lane)

- Scope the staff AI assistant to the staff user's active company, then drop `X-MCP-Scope`.
- `crm_project_forecast`, `crm_purchase_request_by_number`: company-owned, no contact param.
- Per-caller tokens (n8n vs CRM): see Shared token above.
- The four record-action write tools (`record_actions.py`) act on any company's record by UUID for any token
  holder; they need a contact or staff gate of their own.
- If a `*_get` tool returns to the catalog, `_resolve_product_reference` (`server.py`) must forward the contact.
