# UAC - "Requested by" as a contact FK + CS routing on the requestor

Acceptance criteria for `PLAN-requested-by-contact-routing.md`. Every line must pass (BE + FE) with an
automated test or a scripted check before manual eyeball. Regression lines are hard blockers.

## Journey (Phase 0 - governing)

**Actor:** a contact (salesman / agent) opening the submission portal from a WhatsApp link.

Today the portal asks "Requested by" (PR / SF) and "Salesperson" (stock inquiry) as **free text**,
pre-filled with the submitting contact's own name. Darren submits on behalf of other salesmen and
never for himself. CS routing reads the **submitter**, so Darren's forms miss Eric Ng's pinned CS and
land on round robin - every time, and there will never be a pin for Darren.

New journey:

1. Contact opens the portal link. System already knows who they are (portal token → respond contact).
2. Form shows **Requested by** as a picker, pre-filled with themselves - one tap for the common case,
   one selection for Darren's case. Nothing else in the journey changes.
3. The list they choose from is not "every contact in the CRM": it is the contacts belonging to
   market segments an admin has marked as selectable (e.g. Project). Names only - no phone, no
   company, nothing else leaked into a portal that any token-holder can open.
4. They submit. The form routes to the CS pinned for the **person the request is for**, not the person
   who typed it. The submitter still owns the conversation: every status update, approval message and
   portal link keeps going back to whoever submitted.

Derived, not asked: the requestor defaults to the submitter; the label text stored on the row is
derived from the chosen contact, so PDFs / list search / portal search need no new field.

## A. Schema / migration

- A1 ☐ Migration adds `market_segments.is_requestor_selectable BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false`.
- A2 ☐ Migration adds `purchase_requests.requested_by_contact_id UUID NULL` FK →
  `respond_contacts(id) ON DELETE SET NULL`, indexed. (PR **and** SF share this table.)
- A3 ☐ Migration adds `stock_inquiries.salesperson_contact_id UUID NULL` FK →
  `respond_contacts(id) ON DELETE SET NULL`, indexed.
- A4 ☐ Existing free-text `purchase_requests.requested_by` / `stock_inquiries.salesperson` columns are
  **kept** and remain the display label (PDF, list columns, portal search unchanged).
- A5 ☐ Migration is idempotent (re-run = no-op) and chains onto the committed head; `alembic heads`
  shows exactly ONE head after merge.
- A6 ☐ Downgrade drops the three additions cleanly and leaves the text columns untouched.
- A7 ☐ `alembic upgrade head` then `downgrade -1` then `upgrade head` round-trips on a scratch schema.

## B. Segment gate (catalog + admin UI)

- B1 ☐ `GET` market-segments catalog returns `is_requestor_selectable` per row.
- B2 ☐ `PUT` market segment toggles `is_requestor_selectable`; other fields unaffected.
- B3 ☐ Settings → Market Segments **Edit market segment** modal renders a "Selectable as requestor"
  checkbox; save persists and the DataGrid reflects it.
- B4 ☐ Zero segments flagged → requestor list is EMPTY except the submitter (see D3). No 500, no
  "all contacts" fallback (fail closed - this list is a directory).

## C. Requestor options endpoint

- C1 ☐ Portal (token-auth) `GET .../portal/requestor-options?token=…&q=` returns contacts having ≥1
  **active** segment with `is_requestor_selectable = true`, shape `[{id, name}]` - **names only**.
- C2 ☐ Response contains no phone, no `respond_io_id`, no email, no company, no segment codes.
- C3 ☐ `q` filters server-side (case-insensitive substring on name); results capped (default 50) and
  ordered by name; the cap is documented in the response (`has_more`).
- C4 ☐ Invalid / expired / missing token → 401, never a partial list.
- C5 ☐ Internal (JWT) `GET /api/v1/.../respond-contacts/requestor-select?q=` returns the same set for
  CRM-side edit forms; requires a valid principal (401/403 otherwise).
- C6 ☐ A contact whose only flagged segment is INACTIVE is excluded.
- C7 ☐ Duplicate names are returned as distinct rows (id-keyed); the UI must not collapse them.

## D. Portal form (PR / SF / stock inquiry)

- D1 ☐ "Requested by" (PR/SF) and "Salesperson" (stock inquiry) render as a searchable select, not a
  text input. Placeholder + states: loading / empty / error / data.
- D2 ☐ Default selection = the submitting contact.
- D3 ☐ The submitting contact is ALWAYS an option, even when they belong to no flagged segment
  (self-service can never be blocked).
- D4 ☐ Field is required to submit PR / SF / stock inquiry; validation message is human-readable.
- D5 ☐ Submitting persists BOTH `*_contact_id` and the derived label text.
- D6 ☐ Re-opening a draft / rejected form pre-selects the saved contact by id and shows its name
  (no UUID visible anywhere, per the cursor rule).
- D7 ☐ A saved contact that has since lost eligibility still renders its name when re-opened
  (`selectedOption` passthrough), and can be kept on re-submit.
- D8 ☐ Works at ~375px width (mobile): the picker opens, scrolls, and is dismissible.
- D9 ☐ Complaint portal form is **untouched** (its `salesperson` stays free text this slice).

## E. Routing (the actual bug)

- E1 ☐ Darren submits a PR with requested_by = Eric Ng, Eric has a CS pin matching the form →
  the tracker assigns to Eric's pinned CS.
- E2 ☐ Same, but Eric has NO pin → **round robin** (never falls back to the submitter's pin).
- E3 ☐ `requested_by_contact_id` NULL (legacy / internal-created row) → behaviour byte-identical to
  today: pin lookup on the submitter, then round robin. **REGRESSION (hard).**
- E4 ☐ `tracker.respond_contact_id` is ALWAYS the submitting contact, never the requestor - so the
  chat panel, `_notify_*` WhatsApp sends, and portal links keep addressing the submitter.
- E5 ☐ Stock inquiry `project_sales` and `purchasing` stages both use the requestor for pin lookup.
- E6 ☐ PR/SF approval stage: default-approver override still wins over pin + round robin (unchanged).
- E7 ☐ Requestor contact deleted (FK SET NULL) → routing degrades to E3, no exception.
- E8 ☐ Editing `requested_by` after submit does NOT re-assign an already-active tracker; the next
  spawned stage uses the new value. Asserted, not incidental.
- E9 ☐ Every failure path in requestor resolution degrades to today's behaviour and logs - a bad FK
  can never 500 a portal submit.

## F. Backfill

- F1 ☐ `scripts/backfill_requested_by_contact.py --dry-run` reports matched / ambiguous / unmatched
  counts and writes NOTHING (no autoflush side effects).
- F2 ☐ Matching is case-insensitive exact on the contact's name and on `first_name + ' ' + last_name`;
  "Eric Ng" → Eric Ng, "ERIC" → Eric Ng only when exactly one contact matches.
- F3 ☐ Ambiguous ("Cindy" with both *Cindy* and *Cindy Lee* present) → left NULL and listed in the
  report. Never guessed.
- F4 ☐ Idempotent JOIN-based "set where mismatch": re-running corrects prior wrong values, not just
  NULLs (per the backfill lesson).
- F5 ☐ Batched by keyset, not `yield_per` + commit; verified at `--batch 1`.
- F6 ☐ Covers `purchase_requests` (PR + SF) and `stock_inquiries`; does not touch complaints.
- F7 ☐ Live run output is captured in the PR description (matched / left-null lists).

## G. Tests

- G1 ☐ pytest: routing matrix E1-E9 as service-level tests on Postgres (no sqlite), seeding real FK
  targets.
- G2 ☐ pytest: endpoint tests for C1-C7 (happy path + auth denial + validation).
- G3 ☐ pytest: backfill matcher table F2-F3 as pure-function tests (paraphrase/casing table, not one
  hard-coded string).
- G4 ☐ vitest: portal picker component - loading / empty / error / data, default-to-submitter,
  required validation, saved-but-ineligible contact renders.
- G5 ☐ playwright: portal → open PR → pick a requestor other than self → submit → assert the
  `/api/v1/*` payload carries `requested_by_contact_id` and the row lands on the expected assignee.
- G6 ☐ Full backend suite green with zero `errors` (exclusive DB).

## H. No-regression

- H1 ☐ PR / SF / stock inquiry PDF exports render "Requested by" / "Salesperson" exactly as before.
- H2 ☐ Portal search by requestor name (`portal_service` ilike on the text columns) still matches.
- H3 ☐ CRM list columns + DataGrid sorting on those fields unchanged.
- H4 ☐ Internally-created (non-portal) PR / SF / stock inquiry rows still submit with the field empty
  where it is optional today.
