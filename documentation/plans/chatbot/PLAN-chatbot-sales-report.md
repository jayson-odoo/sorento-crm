# PLAN - Chatbot sales report: confirmed vs outstanding sales, by month, one shape

Status: BUILT, Phase 3 fix round in progress 19 Sep 2026; DRAFT PR #1034.
UAC: `chatbot-sales-report-acceptance-criteria.md` (AC-16xx, rulings S1 to S13).
Base: origin/main. The turn re-architecture (#952, #863) is on hold by owner ruling and this
lane does not wait for it. Branch `feat/chatbot-sales-report`, one lane, one PR.
Precedent: `PLAN-chatbot-outstanding-report.md` (#862). This plan copies that lane's seams,
each with the justification that earned it, and adds no new mechanism.

## Journey

See the UAC's Journey section (seven steps). Decisions asked of the user: none beyond the
existing customer picker when a name is ambiguous. Everything else is derived: no date = all
dates, no channel word = all, breakdown axis follows the subject.

## Why a new route and not `order_analytics`

`GET /order-management/orders/analytics` exists, but it sums the DO table, whose line money
is unusable (UAC "Measured": August 2026 sums to 136.3M against 23.2M), it groups on one axis
only, and it knows nothing of confirmed vs outstanding. Repairing the DO import is a separate
problem with no reader today (UAC backlog). The SO lines already hold everything this report
needs, so the report reads them and nothing else.

```

Miss: header, blank line, `No sales found.`, no offer. Denied: `Sales report is not enabled
for your account.` and nothing else.

`Location:` prints exactly as the outstanding header does, through the same
`_outstanding_location_header` rule: `IB (BRW-IB, MWH-IB)` when a token was typed, the bare code when the token IS the one code
(`BRW-IB`), `all` when no token. The lane always sends the token with the codes (captain ruling 19 Sep, parity with S9).

## Backend contract

`GET /api/v1/order-management/sales-report` on the no-prefix router beside
`outstanding-report` (`app/api/v1/order_management/orders.py`), same auth dependency and
view permission as that route.

| param | type | rule |
|---|---|---|
| `product_code` | str | exact, case-insensitive |
| `customer_ids` | csv uuid | the lane's resolved ledgers |
| `customer_query` | str | `customer_name ILIKE %q%`, for n8n / the in-app assistant |
| `channel` | `dealer` / `project` | absent = all; else 422 |
| `warehouse_codes` | csv | exact codes; token resolution stays in the lane |
| `location_token` | str | echo only, the word the customer typed (`IB`); never filters. Same as the outstanding route |
| `date_from`, `date_to` | flex date | on the bucket date, `_parse_flex_date` |
| `detail` | `so` | adds `so_rows[]` |

At least one of `product_code` / `customer_ids` / `customer_query`, else 422
`subject_required`.

Response (`SalesReportResponse`, every field declared):

```
{
  "customer_name": str | null, "product_code": str | null, "channel": "dealer"|"project"|null,
  "location_token": str | null, "warehouse_codes": [str], "date_from": date|null, "date_to": date|null,
  "months": [ { "month": "2026-09", "so_count": int,
                "ordered_value", "ordered_qty", "confirmed_value", "confirmed_qty",
                "outstanding_value", "outstanding_qty",
                "by_product":  [ { "product_code",  ...same six figures } ],   # customer subject
                "by_customer": [ { "customer_name", ...same six figures } ] } ],# product subject
  "so_rows": [ { "so_number", "customer_name", "location", "order_date", ...six figures } ]
}
```

One service function `sales_report(db, filters) -> dict` in a new
`app/services/sales_report_service.py`. ONE base query over `sales_order_lines` joined to
`sales_orders`, `customers`, `products`, `warehouses`, filtered `sales_orders.status <>
'cancelled' AND line_status <> 'cancelled'`, selecting per line:

- `bucket = COALESCE(l.required_date, s.order_date)`
- `confirmed_qty = LEAST(l.qty_delivered, l.qty_ordered)`
- `confirmed_value = l.line_total * confirmed_qty / NULLIF(l.qty_ordered, 0)` (null to 0)
- `outstanding_qty = l.qty_ordered - confirmed_qty` when `s.status = 'open' AND
  l.line_status = 'open'`, else 0; `outstanding_value = l.line_total - confirmed_value` under
  the same condition, else 0
- `ordered = confirmed + outstanding` (value and quantity), so the identity is arithmetic

Months, breakdowns and `so_rows` are rolled up in Python from those rows, the way
`outstanding_report_service.py` does, so a breakdown can never drift from its total. Decimal
throughout, quantised to 2 places at the response edge. `_customer_echo` is imported from the
outstanding service, not copied. No registry, no list-query resource: the chatbot is the only
reader and the shape is a report, not a grid.

No migration for data. One migration publishes the parser prompt text (S4 below).

## Slices

| slice | phase | what | files |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | 1 | Presenter over mock JSON; goldens for customer / product / both / miss / detail; dash guard | `sorento_crm_mcp/sorento_crm_mcp/presenters.py` (`_sales_report`, `_sales_report_detail`, shared money formatter), `documentation/plans/chatbot/samples/sales-report-*.txt` + `.json`, `sorento_crm_mcp/tests/test_presenters_sales_report.py` |
| S2 | 2 | Route + service + response model | `app/api/v1/order_management/orders.py`, `app/services/sales_report_service.py`, `app/schemas/order_management.py`, `tests/test_sales_report.py` |
| S3 | 2 | MCP tool + reveal key (NO assistant bootstrap - struck 19 Sep, security B1: the in-app assistant must never carry `crm_sales_report`, same reason as `crm_low_stock_report`, N4) | `sorento_crm_mcp/sorento_crm_mcp/catalog.py` (`crm_sales_report`), `app/services/contact_field_reveal_service.py` (`FIELD_REVEAL_KEYS`), `app/services/mcp_tool_domains.py`, `sorento_crm_mcp/tests/test_catalog_sales_report.py` |

| S5 | 3 | reviewer + security-reviewer (new route, per-contact key, company scope) + console check + one browser pass on Contacts > Access, in parallel; then guide-writer | `documentation/plans/chatbot/evidence/sales-report/`, `documentation/user-guides/system-management/chatbot-sales-report.md` |

Phase 1 for a chatbot lane is the presenter against a mock: the "UI" is the WhatsApp text and
the goldens are its screenshots. The owner reviews the goldens before S2 starts.

## S4 wiring, smallest shape that fits each seam

1. **Parser** (`chatbot_parser_prompt.py`, published by one migration the way 514 was):
   `order_status` gains `sales_report` (sales report / sales performance / how much did X
   buy); a new nullable output field `sales_channel` = `dealer` / `project`, emitted only on
   a sales report ask. Allowlisted in `contracts.py`. The prompt says in words that "dealer"
   inside an outstanding ask is NOT a channel. No word table anywhere in Python (S12).
2. **Carry**: `sales_channel` is persisted and restored beside `order_status` /
   `date_filter_*` in the SAME reuse arm R16 built (`tail/compile_state.py` write,
   `head/output_exchange.py` reuse branch), so a customer-picker answer ("1" or "all")
   continues the ask with its channel. Same rule, same justification, no picker branch.
3. **Tool pick** (`fetch.py`): domain `order` AND (resolved product OR resolved customer) AND
   `order_status == "sales_report"` picks `crm_sales_report`. One more branch beside the
   outstanding one.
4. **Gate** (S10): before any fetch, read `ctx["access"]["attributes"]` for
   `sales_orders.sales_report` the way the outstanding lane reads its key. Absent = the
   denial line, no fetch, no offer. There is no fallback scope here, so this is simpler than
   D13.
5. **Params**: `DATE_PARAMS["crm_sales_report"] = ("date_from", "date_to")`; customer to
   `customer_ids`; location through the existing warehouse resolver to `warehouse_codes`;
   product through `outstanding_product_code` (typed code wins); `sales_channel` to `channel`.
6. **No scope question.** The report always prints confirmed AND outstanding, so nothing like
   `outstanding_scope` exists here.
7. **Detail offer** (S11): a hit arms `selection_context = "sales_report_detail"` with one row
   (`Sales order list`, `so`) and stores the filter set plus `tool: "crm_sales_report"`. The
   arms that today test `kind == "outstanding_detail"` (`tail/pending.py::derive`,
   `compile_state._offer_carry`, `output_exchange._apply_outstanding_pending`, the parser
   option-label feed in `head/parser.py::build_user_block`) test membership in ONE shared
   constant `DETAIL_OFFER_KINDS = {"outstanding_detail", "sales_report_detail"}`, and the
   re-run reads the tool name from the stored filter set (absent = `crm_outstanding_report`,
   so sessions open at deploy keep working). Sticky, decline, reprint-once, refinement and
   new-ask behaviour arrive for free and are pinned for both kinds by one parametrized test
   family (AC-1655, AC-1656). This honours the standing note "no NEW open-question kind arm
   is added to the head": a kind value is added, an arm is not.
8. **Picker hint off** (`resolve_gate.py`): R20's rule extended to `sales_report`, same
   reason (the has-DO probe measures a different population).
9. **Header skip** (`compile_state._search_scope_header`): skipped for `crm_sales_report`.
10. **Miss**: no months returns the presenter's miss text through `not_found_error_message`,
    so the escalate offer follows unchanged.

## Design brief

Surface: WhatsApp text, read a few times a day by management and sales. Nothing animates. No
emoji. Bold italic on month titles and breakdown sub-headings, bold on detail-row labels (the
existing convention). Contacts > Access gains one row through its existing list; no new UI.

## Definition of done notes

- No new column, so no dict-builder sweep. No new permission slug: the route reuses the
  outstanding report's view permission; the per-contact key is a reveal key, not RBAC, so
  there is no role grant sweep. The owner ticks the key per contact after deploy.
- After deploy: prompt republish (the migration does it), MCP restart so `sync_catalog`
  seeds `crm_sales_report`, then the console check against production.

## Risks

- Length. HANLIM over all dates is 37 months at about 80 products each, about 3,000 lines.
  Ruled acceptable (S5); n8n chunks. Backlog trigger recorded in the UAC.
- `required_date` is a REQUESTED date: 10,542 lines dated 2026 sit in future months, out to
  2032. Printed as they are (S3).
- 22,717 priced lines dated 2026 carry `line_total = 0`. They count quantity at RM 0.00. If
  the owner sees a month whose value looks low, this is the first place to look.
- `output_exchange.py` is the file every chatbot lane collides in. The change there is a
  membership test and a tool-name read, kept that small on purpose.
