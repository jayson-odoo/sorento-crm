# PLAN: v1 chatbot - unlinked non-staff contacts get no other customers' documents (V1-DOC-SCOPE)

Status: in review (small fix track + security review; no migration, no new reply text). PR #1648;
V1-DOC-SCOPE-R round (19 Oct, hold lifted by the owner): main merged, paths re-verified, gates running.

## Problem

An unlinked non-staff contact (no customer link, no active office access type; owner rule:
unlinked != customer) can name a delivery-order number, or a sales-order number with the
`sales_orders.outstanding` reveal, and v1 answers with that document for ANY customer.

## Fix (same shapes v1 already uses)

1. The resolver per-match drop (`turn_runtime._without_foreign_sales_orders`) also drops a
   delivery-order match whose customer is not in the contact's links (the
   `so_status._scope_check` rule). Unlinked non-staff: no customer document matches.
2. Business lane SO-by-number with the reveal: `linked = None if ref_staff else links`, the
   rule the PO-ref branch already uses.
3. DO list asks with no number: scoped to links for non-staff (empty links: nothing). Security
   review added the other arms that list customer documents: the outstanding report and the SO
   list are refused the same way; "did you mean" alternatives and the casual clarifier prompt
   go through the per-match drop; the customer PO-ref arm holds an enforced contact to its links.

Staff unchanged. Blocked cases reuse the existing refusal line ("Sorry, that isn't under your
account. I can only check on your own account.").

## Who is staff (crew ruling (a), 14 Oct)

Staff = `chatbot_profile.tier == "office"` OR an active office access type
(`contact_customer_scope.is_office_staff`), the same rule in all three fixes. The engine reads the
scope and the office access bit once per turn (`services.customer_scope_and_staff`) and hands the
bit to the resolver drop and the tool runner, which writes `doc_staff` for the lane every turn.
`ref_staff` (tier only) still gates our own PO / PR reveals. Both keys are engine-only
(`required_fields.ENGINE_KEYS`), so a parser-emitted copy is dropped.

Existing tests in 33 files seeded an unlinked, tierless contact playing an office role; they
now mark it staff explicitly (an office access type, so the tier-driven escalation offer is
unchanged; about 90 marks, per test or in the file's own seeder), assertions unchanged. The
shared `test_outstanding_lane._seed_contact` stays non-staff: about 90 tests rely on that.

## Salespeople keep document access (V1-DOC-SCOPE-SALES, crew rulings 14 Oct)

The owner's prod check found many of the unlinked non-staff contacts are salespeople. For
document access a salesperson is ONLY an ACTIVE, not trashed CRM user linked to the contact
(`users.respond_contact_id`) holding the not trashed role `salesperson`
(`contact_asker.is_salesperson_user`; owner rule 11 Oct). Security review: `classify`'s
`sales_agents.contact_id` arm would keep access after the user is deactivated and would let
`master_data.sales_agents.edit` grant it, so an agent link, an inactive or trashed user, or
another role grants nothing (crew ruling (a)). A customer link does not make such a contact a
dealer. For document scope it is staff:

- `services.customer_scope_and_staff` returns staff = office access type OR salesperson, so
  `doc_staff` includes it. An unlinked salesperson sees DO / SO by number, the DO list, the SO
  list and the outstanding report, as main does today (the 81-contact fix).
- A linked salesperson keeps the core `enforced` flag, so the customer-word gate, the lists, top
  selling, report_ask and the order routes hold it to its links exactly as main does (CA-3 pins,
  `tests/chatbot/test_chat_report_scope_leak.py`, unchanged). It is lifted only on the
  in-process by-number arms: the SO number lookup (scope `staff`) and the resolver per-match drop
  (`engine._reference_scope`). The tier alone still never lifts an enforced scope.
- `ref_staff` stays the tier alone: the customer PO-ref arm and our PO / PR cards behave as main,
  and so does the resolver / clarifier per-match drop for a customer PO ref
  (`po_ref_scope_linked`, `engine._reference_kinds`), so a salesperson never learns which SO
  another customer's PO ref is.
- Routes unchanged (ruling (a)). Follow-up (b), only if the owner's SQL shows linked salespeople:
  make the core `contact_customer_scope.enforced` exclude a salesperson so the order routes,
  report_ask and complaints agree with the chatbot.

## Owner ruling 16 Oct: any active staff CRM user is staff

Crew's read-only run of the check SQL on the owner's 15 Oct prod backup found 120 contacts BLOCKED, 26 of
them real staff with active CRM logins but no salesperson role (customer service, project customer
service, warehouse, purchasing, project sales, marketing, technical). Ruling (crew (b)): document staff is
an ACTIVE, not trashed CRM user linked to the contact holding at least one not-trashed role outside
`user_service.NON_STAFF_ROLE_SLUGS` (portal_user, guest), whatever that role is: the people lookups' own
staff definition (`_holds_staff_role`). `contact_asker.is_staff_user` replaces `is_salesperson_user`. A
dealer's portal login (`user_contact_link.suggested_role_slug` pre-selects portal_user for a contact that
is not a salesperson), a roleless or inactive / trashed user and a sales agent link grant nothing. The
check SQL lists every active linked user failing the rule with its roles, and (part 2) every
customer-linked contact whose user holds a staff role, for the owner to confirm none is a dealer.

## Slice 3: the customer picker (crew audit at 54740870f, 15 Oct)

`engine._customer_scope_gate` left every unlinked contact untouched, so an unlinked non-staff
contact typing another customer's partial name reached the generic resolver: its customer
picker listed other customers' names, and the picker's DO probe (`resolve_gate`
`CUSTOMER_PROBE_TOOL`, outside `run_fetch`'s guard) stamped which of them have DOs. The gate now
treats an unlinked contact that is not document staff (`unlinked_held`: not the tier, no office
access type, not a salesperson) as owning no customer: a customer word it typed this message
refuses the turn before the resolver, with the existing no-link line, the same path an
enforced dealer's word outside its links takes. No picker, no probe, no resolver call for the
word. (Superseded by V1-DOC-SCOPE-R, 19 Oct: the gate no longer refuses on the parser's tag;
the resolver's `hide_customers` drop and the typed-word refusal below hold the contact.)
Document staff are unchanged. AC-CS-03 ("unlinked contact unchanged: the picker") is
flipped under the owner rule unlinked != customer.

Security review round 2: under `order` the resolver reads a brand, category, product or order
word as the customer it names (`entity_resolver._DOMAIN_HINT_EXPANSIONS`), so the parser's tag is
not enough. For a held contact `resolve_kinds` / `resolve_gate.run` (`hide_customers`) drop every
customer row right after the resolver, before the gate builds a picker or runs its DO probe; a
word typed this message that only matched customers gets the no-link line. A carried customer
word is dropped, never refused, so a refusal cannot lock the next turns. Top selling is no
longer skipped for an unlinked contact.

Crew ruling (b), 15 Oct, keeping the owner's CA-3 Q5(a)
(`PLAN-chat-analytics-ca3-chat-dataset-10oct.md`:181-184): a GRANTED report turn by an unlinked
contact is exempt, picker included: the chat report under `chatbot.analytics`, the sales report
(every `SALES_FIGURE_STATUSES` ask: sales report, top selling, sales analysis, ranking) under
`sales_orders.sales_report`. The owner grants those per contact. Everything else (orders, DO, SO,
outstanding, any domain without such a grant) keeps the slice-3 rule. The CA-3, report_ask and
sales-report suites stay unclassified-asker tests (their slice-3 office marks reverted); without
the grant, SF-1 and the chat lane's own grant check already keep every name away.

Security review rounds 4-5: the grant opens the report's customers, never their delivery orders.
For any unlinked contact that is not document staff (`customer_docs_hidden`, granted report turns
included) none of the three customer DO probe sites runs: the gate's picker arm
(`resolve_gate.run(skip_customer_probe=...)`), the roster stamp (`stamp_customer`) and the
narrower's PICKER-ONE stamp (`turn_runtime.stamp_customer_ask`). The low_signal clarifier asks
the resolver itself, so a held contact's customer rows are dropped from its prompt too.

Queued follow-up (crew, 15 Oct, after this PR merges): the same clarifier drop for an ENFORCED
dealer, keeping only its own links' customer rows (pre-existing gap, same files).

## V1-DOC-SCOPE-R: bring to current main (19 Oct)

The owner lifted the hold on 19 Oct. Crew's combined held-out runs (17 and 18 Oct, builds without this PR)
showed 6 scope leaks per run, all delivery-order / order class: an unlinked non-staff contact got another
customer's debtor name, products, qty, driver, lorry plate, dates. The bar is 0.

1. Merge origin/main (CHAT-STATE #1747, EVAL-BENCH #1762 and the 16-19 Oct chatbot merges); one alembic
   head, no migration on this lane.
2. Re-verify on the merged head every path that can show another customer's SO / DO / PO to an unlinked
   non-staff contact: the SO card via `_so_numbers_asked`, the DO by number, the orders list, the PO list,
   plus any path main added since 16 Oct (CHAT-STATE follow-ups carry a referenced document across turns).
   Salespeople and other active staff users keep access. A path still open gets a `test(red):` commit
   first, then the fix, then a kill-proof.
3. Gates: $0 L1 replay (EVAL-BENCH), reviewer and security-reviewer on the head, then `ci please`.

Found this round (no document path was open; crew's two held-out classes are pinned in
`TestHeldOutLeakClasses`, red on main's code):

- The three no-link refusals (orders read `_DOC_TOOLS`, SO list, SO number arm) are marked
  `refused`, so CHAT-FIT-LINE (AC-23) puts no fit line above them.
- Slice 3's gate refused any word the PARSER tagged a customer, before the resolver, so an end
  user's "cabana stock" with cabana mis-tagged got the no-link line instead of the brand stock
  answer (owner Q1, `test_class_hint_kind_pick`). The gate is back to main's shape; the contact
  is held after the resolver only (`resolve_kinds(hide_customers=...)` drops customer rows before
  any picker or DO probe, a word typed this message that matched only customers gets the no-link
  line), and run_fetch still refuses every orders, outstanding and SO read.
- Owner ruling 19 Oct: the sales report's Delivery orders drill stays open to a contact granted
  `sales_orders.sales_report`, unlinked included (AC-13); no follow-up.

## Open before merge

The owner runs `crew/state/reports/V1-DOC-SCOPE-salesperson-check.sql` (read-only) on production
and gives every real salesperson shown as BLOCKED an ACTIVE CRM user with the role `salesperson`
(its `to_fix` column says what is missing).


The owner runs the read-only SQL in the PR's crew-done comment on production to see which unlinked
contacts with neither marker asked order questions in the last 60 days (they lose those answers).
