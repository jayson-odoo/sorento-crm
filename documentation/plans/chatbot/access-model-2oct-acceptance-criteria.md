# UAC - Chatbot access model: roles -> domains -> fields, one registry

Plan: `PLAN-access-model-2oct.md`. Card: `CARD-access-model-2oct.md` (owner answers 2 Oct 2026).
Mock: `documentation/mockups/ACCESS-MODEL/index.html` (v3). IDs AC-AM-n.

## Roles (dynamic, owner-configurable)

- AC-AM-1 Roles are rows (`chatbot_roles`). An admin with `user_management.reference_data.manage` (the slug that guards contact access type writes today) can
  create, rename, describe and delete a role, and set "Sees all customers", from Chatbot Roles
  (User management > Access). No role code or name appears in application code; the 5 presets
  (Dealer, Sales office, Purchasing, Warehouse, Management) exist only as migration seed rows.
- AC-AM-2 On a role page the admin ticks domains and, inside a domain, fields; Save (n) writes only the
  changed rows; the page re-reads and shows the saved ticks. View and edit are the same layout.
- AC-AM-3 Deleting a role is a 10 s deferred action with Cancel, no confirm dialog. A role held by any
  contact is refused (409, message names the number of contacts); a role held by none is hard-deleted
  with its ticks.
- AC-AM-4 Adding/removing a contact on the role page and on the contact Access tab write the same row; contact role/override writes need `user_management.contacts.edit` (as field reveals today, `system/chatbot_field_reveals.py:48,86`); reads need `user_management.access_agents.view`.

- AC-AM-4b The tree has two sections, Domains and Reports. Reports lists every report-type grant: Low
  stock report, Outstanding SO report, Sales report. A report answers only when its owning domain is
  granted too (Low stock report needs Stock, Outstanding SO report needs Orders / DO); granting a
  report never grants its owning domain. The parser's domain list is unchanged by this lane.

## Contact access

- AC-AM-5 A contact's access = union of its roles' ticks, then its own overrides (domain or field,
  add or remove). For the same domain/field a contact "remove" beats any role "add".
- AC-AM-6 Deny by default: a contact with no role and no add-override reaches no domain; every domain
  ask gets the canned no-access reply (`lanes/canned.py`), and its prompt holds no domain-tagged block.
- AC-AM-7 (mock v8, final) The contact Access tab is one page read top-down: a summary box ("This
  contact can ask about ...", customers, region, extra details, "cannot ask: ..."), then 1 Roles (chips
  with tier, add/remove), 2 Customers they can ask about (read-only, from the roles), 3 Region (West /
  East checkboxes, at least one), 4 What they can ask (one switch per domain, grouped in plain-English
  sections; details open ONE level as a checklist; the two stamp switches with their before/after
  preview sit in the details of Incoming stock and Product photos and documents). A row that follows the
  roles shows nothing extra; a row the contact differs on is highlighted with "Changed for this contact"
  and a "Reset to role" action that removes that contact's overrides for the row. One sticky Save bar
  shows the number of unsaved changes and sends one PUT. No keys, codes or prompt hints are shown;
  hand-off teams sit in a collapsed "Advanced" section. The old Access Agents grid and Field reveals
  switches are gone. The role page has the same shape (name and tier, customers radio, switches,
  contacts, Advanced).
- AC-AM-8 Two contact rows sharing one respond.io id in one workspace get the INTERSECTION of their
  access (fail closed).
- AC-AM-9 A role with "Sees all customers" unscopes order answers; a contact with linked customers and
  no such role is scoped to them; a contact with neither is refused order/outstanding/sales asks.
  "Sorento/Cabana/Mocha Office" access types no longer decide customer scope.
- AC-AM-10 No validity window: access does not lapse on a date (today's grants all end 2026-12-30/31).

## Owner additions (ruled 2 Oct: Q1-Q4 all (a))

- AC-AM-22 A contact may hold several roles at once (e.g. Sales office and Dealer); grants are the union;
  `sees_all_customers` and staff behaviour apply if ANY held role has them; a contact remove-override
  still beats every role.
- AC-AM-23 Tier (Dealer / Office / End user) is a property of the role (`audience_tier`), not a single
  contact picker; a contact with Dealer and Office roles gets staff behaviour and promotions for both tiers.
- AC-AM-24 The incoming stamp and the product-attachment stamp are tree fields ticked on every seeded
  role; unticking one for a contact makes that contact's rosters print without it (and without the
  "None of these have incoming stock right now." line); the roster rows and order are unchanged.

- AC-AM-25 Region is a per-contact scope (West, East, or both; East also sees West), set on the
  contact Access tab. `EffectiveAccess.regions` carries the expanded set and is the only thing the
  incoming / packing-list answers read for region (`eta_policy.contact_regions`). Stored as
  `respond_contacts.regions` (`west`/`east`, non-empty, default West). Duplicate respond.io rows get the
  intersection of raw sets then expansion; an empty or unresolved set gets West only. The contact
  access GET/PUT carries `regions`; an empty list or an unknown code is 422. Region never grants or
  removes a domain or field.

## Enforcement and prompt read ONE tree

- AC-AM-11 `effective_access(db, contact)` is the only reader of roles/overrides for a chat turn. Both
  the domain gate (`Profile.grants`, `turn/apply.py:2199`) and the field/ask gates
  (`ctx.access.attributes`) are filled from it; the agent check (`evaluate_agent`) no longer gates a
  chat turn.
- AC-AM-12 Leak matrix: for every (role preset, domain, field) a test asserts that a domain/field absent
  from the contact's access is (a) absent from its rendered parser prompt and (b) refused or stripped
  at fetch/answer, including when the ask is phrased to name that domain directly.
- AC-AM-13 Access is read before the parser prompt is rendered, so the trimmed prompt is the one the
  parser sees on the same turn.
- AC-AM-14 Every parser block that belongs to a domain or field is tagged with it; untagged blocks render
  for everyone. Full-access render equals today's production text (byte-for-byte check in the migration test).

## Registry

- AC-AM-15 `chatbot_domains` + `chatbot_domain_fields` are the only source for domains, fields, tools,
  field labels and reveal keys. `FIELD_REVEAL_KEYS`, `SUGGESTED_AGENTS`, the incoming `GATED_FIELDS`
  list and `CHATBOT_TOOL_DOMAINS` are derived from rows; `default_policy()` remains only where the
  plan names it (blank-install default, security allow-list).
- AC-AM-16 Adding a feature = one domain or field row + its prompt block tag + tool on the row; it is
  ticked on no role until an admin ticks it (test: insert a row, no contact gains access).

## Escalation (agents stay for routing)

- AC-AM-17 Each domain row carries `escalation_agent_code` (FK `access_agents.code`) next to
  `escalation_team_code`; a hand-off uses the DOMAIN's agent, not the parser's `suggested_agent`.
  A domain with no team offers no hand-off. Contact Access tab lists agent / team set / tier-1 team per
  granted domain beside "Can escalate to a person".
- AC-AM-18 `access_agents`, `agent_teams`, SLA, ticket/complaint routing and the n8n preflight
  `/external/access-agent/check` behave exactly as before.

## Migration (no internal user loses access)

- AC-AM-19 The migration creates the 5 roles with the card section 2 ticks and assigns every contact per
  the mapping SQL: on the 25 Sep prod copy Sales office 87, Purchasing 5, Management 2, none 6, with
  overrides for CONTACT Q, CONTACT A (-sellable -on order -purchase orders), CONTACT F (+outstanding),
  CONTACT O (+20 incoming fields).
- AC-AM-20 Loss check: for every contact, every reveal key and agent-reachable domain it had before is
  still granted after (test on a seeded chain + a read-only script run on the dev copy, zero lost rows).
- AC-AM-21 Migration applied and checked on a dev copy before the hand test; idempotent SQL handed to crew.
