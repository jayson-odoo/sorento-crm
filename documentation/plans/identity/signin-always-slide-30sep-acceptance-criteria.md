# UAC: CRM sign-in always uses the 30-day sliding session (SIGNIN-ALWAYS-SLIDE)

Plan: `PLAN-signin-always-slide-30sep.md`. Owner, 30 Sep 2026: "sign in, be it phone or email, needs
the same mechanism as portal; I don't want the user to tick remember me; when there is activity on
continuous days the session just continues".

| AC | Given / When / Then | Test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AC-1 | Given a staff user, when they sign in by email with no `remember_me` or with `remember_me=false`, then a session is minted with `rolling=true` and about 30 days left. | `sorento_crm_backend/tests/test_auth_login.py` `test_regression_login_mints_30d_session_that_slides_after_a_day` |
| AC-2 | Given that session with under 29 days left (a day or more has passed), when the user makes any request, then `expires_at` moves forward to about now + 30 days. Repeated daily activity keeps it alive. | same test; `tests/test_user_session_service.py` `test_activity_on_consecutive_days_keeps_session_alive` |
| AC-3 | Given any `/auth/login` payload (`remember_me` missing, false, null or true), then no session shorter than 30 days is minted; the 8h path no longer exists. | `tests/test_auth_login.py` `test_regression_login_never_mints_a_session_shorter_than_30d`; `tests/test_user_session_service.py` `test_mint_takes_no_remember_choice` |
| AC-4 | Given phone OTP sign-in, then it still mints the 30-day sliding session and slides on activity. | `tests/test_identity_s1_phone_signin.py` `test_regression_phone_otp_session_is_30d_and_slides_after_a_day`, `test_ac24_verify_success_returns_login_shape_and_mints_session` |
| AC-5 | Given the sign-in page, in email mode and in phone mode, at 1280px and 375px, then there is no "Remember me" checkbox, and the email submit sends no `rememberMe`. | `sorento_crm_frontend/app/(auth)/signin/page.test.tsx` (email/phone mode tests, payload test, AC-29 control count); agent-browser evidence run in the plan |
| AC-6 | Revocation still applies: logout, device revoke, revoke-others, password reset/change and admin force logout / deactivation end the session on the next request. | `tests/test_auth_login.py` `test_email_session_revoke_still_ends_it`; existing `tests/test_user_session_service.py` revoke tests, `tests/test_identity_s1_password.py`, `tests/test_identity_s1_security_round.py` |

Out of scope: an absolute session cap (owner: pure sliding, exactly like the portal); migrating
existing `rolling=false` rows (they keep their fixed 8h and lapse).
