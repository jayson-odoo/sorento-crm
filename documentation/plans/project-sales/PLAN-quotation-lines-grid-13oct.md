# PLAN: Quotation lines grid (13 Oct)

Status: REVIEW-CLEAN after owner hand-test round 1, owner re-test pending (size L: one additive migration; security-reviewer joins
because the line write accepts attachment ids). Owner answers 14 Oct recorded in the UAC. PR #1643.

Lane: QUOTATION-UX, branch `crew/quotation-ux`. Source: owner notes 13 Oct on Project Sales >
Project > New quotation > Lines (screenshots 607 to 612 in the crew brief). Mock v2:
`documentation/mockups/QUOTATION-UX/index.html`. Acceptance criteria:
`quotation-lines-grid-13oct-acceptance-criteria.md`. Lane test DB: `sorento_qux_ci`
(`sorento_crm_backend/.env.ci-tests`, gitignored).

## Facts the plan rests on

- Editor: `app/(protected)/project-sales/[projectId]/components/QuotationVersionEditor.tsx` over
  `_shared/components/InlineLineTable.tsx` (`:808-870`). Save sends the staged array; order is array
  position, `sort_order` is not sent (`:136-143`), so a drag only permutes the staged array.
  InlineLineTable has no reorder. PO, SO and series editors also use it and are NOT touched.
- `components/ui/data-grid-table-dnd-rows.tsx` (`DataGridTableDndRows` `:98`, handle `:41`, aria
  "Drag to reorder") has row drag + column resize but no column drag, `<tfoot>`, full-width or
  expanded rows. `data-grid-table-dnd.tsx` has column drag + footer + expanded rows, no row drag.
  Editable DataGrid with row drag precedent: `master-data-management/product-specifications/
  components/SpecRulesGrid.tsx:549-640`. Read-only row-drag precedent:
  `[projectId]/components/SalesOrderLinesTable.tsx:415-464, 541-552`.
- Line photo: `product_image_service.py` (one decision, `is_primary`, `_photograph` filter
  `:105-114`); per line: `project_quotation_image_service.line_images` (`:54-119`); frozen at issue
  by `freeze_version_images` (`:135-164`, called at `project_quotation_document_service.py:572`).
  `image_attachment_id` is ALREADY client-writable (`LINE_FIELDS` `project_quotation_service.py:63-85`,
  schema `schemas/projects.py:1224`) with no check that it belongs to the product: fixed here.
- Attachment kinds by `attachment_types.type_name`: "Product Photos" (2,308 products in dev),
  "Technical Specifications" (1,180 products; 56 with several). Precedent for matching on the name:
  `services/dealer_kit/product_images.py:167-168`.
- "Off-catalog" = `product_id` empty (FE `:1055-1058`, `:119-123`; BE `:522-529`, `:649-657`,
  `:900`). "Counts per" = `unit_type`, changes no total (`:659-661`) and prints nowhere.
- PDF `project_quotation_pdf_service.py:346-400` (image column from stamped id, TECHNICAL SPEC =
  text at `:396`); Excel `project_quotation_excel_service.py:223, 367, 421-434`. Issue-only routes
  (`api/v1/projects/quotation_documents.py:607, 664`).
- Stock: `GET /project-sales/fulfilment-planning/stock-detail?product_id&group=` (`api/v1/projects/
  fulfilment_planning.py:919-970`, service `project_fulfilment_board_service.py:909-1293`), FE
  `useStockDetail` (`_shared/hooks/useFulfilmentPlanning.ts:405-427`), table `CellStockTable`
  (`fulfilment-planning/components/CellStockTable.tsx:238`), OI wrapper
  `_shared/components/OrderInquiryStockGrid.tsx:31` (location -> group via `groupOfWarehouseCode`).

## API contract

Line write (bulk item and single line), new or changed fields:
- `image_attachment_id: str | null` (existing) and `drawing_attachment_id: str | null` (new).
  Validated only when the value differs from the stored one: must be an attachment linked to the
  line's product through `product_attachments`, image mime, not deleted, same company; drawing must
  also be of type "Technical Specifications". Set on a line with no product, or invalid: 422,
  codes `quotation_line_image_invalid` / `quotation_line_drawing_invalid`.
- Description-required 422 message: "A custom item needs a description." (code unchanged).

Line response, new fields (declared on the response model):
- `drawing_attachment_id`.
- `product_image.candidates[]` and `technical_drawing.candidates[]`: `{attachment_id, filename, url,
  preview_url}` (signed thumbnail + original). `product_image.candidate_count` counts "Product
  Photos" images only.
- `technical_drawing`: `{state, url, preview_url, attachment_id, filename, candidate_count,
  candidates}`, state `chosen` (picked or stamped) | `default` (first by `attachments.created_at`,
  then id) | `no_drawings` | `off_catalog`.

## Slices (one branch, one PR)

1. **Migration** `qlg_0001_drawing_attachment`: `projects.quotation_lines.drawing_attachment_id
   UUID NULL REFERENCES attachments(id) ON DELETE SET NULL`. Model, `LINE_FIELDS`, schemas, revise
   copy (`project_quotation_service.py:340-355`). Crew SQL: `crew/state/migrations/QUOTATION-UX.sql`.
2. **Photo rule** (`product_image_service`): no `is_primary` + exactly one "Product Photos" image =
   `chosen` with that image, in every reader. Candidates and `candidate_count` = "Product Photos"
   images only.
3. **Line images + drawings** (`project_quotation_image_service`): candidates for both, drawing
   resolution, freeze fills `drawing_attachment_id` too (fill only). Validation of picked ids in the
   line write.
4. **Print**: PDF and Excel TECHNICAL SPEC = the stamped drawing image; legacy `technical_spec` text
   under the description; description line breaks kept (PDF `white-space: pre-line` or `<br>`).
5. **Shared grid** (FE): `DataGridTableDndRows` gains `<tfoot>` from `columnDef.footer`, full-width
   rows (section bars), expanded rows (`meta.expandedContent`) and column drag. Existing callers
   render unchanged.
6. **Quotation grid** (FE): `QuotationLinesGrid` replaces the InlineLineTable use; same staging
   contract (`:675-696`), validation, search filter and footer rule. Columns per mock section 1;
   Description `Textarea`; Brand `SearchableSelect` over `useBrandSelectQuery`; UOM + stock chip
   under Qty; list price under rate; rate-only tick under total; row menu (Line details, Move up/down,
   Insert line below, Insert section above, Remove). Line details row: Complete set, Priced per,
   Notes. Picker popover for photo and drawing writes `image_attachment_id` /
   `drawing_attachment_id` into the draft; a product change clears both. Column prefs key
   `projects.projects.view::quotation-lines`.
7. **Stock chip** (FE): `QuotationStockChip` = `useStockDetail(productId, null, null, group)` and
   `(..., 'pools')`; popover = `CellStockTable` (as `OrderInquiryStockGrid` renders it) with order-only
   columns and document chevrons hidden by a new prop; incoming SPOs listed. "Stock at" dropdown on
   the Lines tab from the fulfilment-planning warehouses (`groupOfWarehouseCode`), value in
   localStorage under `quotation-lines.stock-group` (try/catch), default first group.
8. **Wording**: Custom item / Pick a product / "A custom item needs a description" / recompute note
   (`QuotationVersionEditor.tsx:969-976`), Priced per labels.

## Tests (tester writes them first, red, from the UAC)

Backend (pytest, `SORENTO_ENV_FILE=.env.ci-tests`, `-n 2` max): extend
`tests/test_product_image_service.py`, `test_project_quotation_images.py`,
`test_project_quotation_bulk_lines.py`, `test_project_quotation_pdf.py`,
`test_project_quotation_excel.py`, `test_project_quotation_document.py` (issue freeze), plus the
migration (column exists, nullable, FK SET NULL).
Frontend (vitest): `QuotationVersionEditor.test.tsx` and new `QuotationLinesGrid.test.tsx`,
`QuotationStockChip.test.tsx`, `data-grid-table-dnd-rows` footer/full-width/expanded test.
Browser: 1280 sidebar open (no horizontal scroll, no truncated header), 375 (no page scroll).

## Owner hand-test round 1 (14 Oct)

1. Scope tab right-click: Rename, Remove scope (QuotationScopeTabs via components/ui/context-menu.tsx; same handlers as the pen and the Remove scope button).
2. Lines: no Line details / Move up / Move down menu items; a click on a row (not an input) toggles its details row; reorder only by the drag handle; right-click on a row and the ... button open Insert a line below, Insert a section above, Remove line.
3. Section bars: right-click Rename, Remove section (clears band_label on the line that opens it; the line stays).
4. Photo and Drawing thumbnails fill their column width, so widening the column enlarges them.
5. UOM gets its own column right of Qty (stock chip stays under Qty); default widths rebalanced so 1280 with the sidebar open still has no horizontal scroll.
6. Columns button (components/ui/data-grid-column-visibility.tsx, as SalesOrderDetail.tsx:1998-2002) to show/hide columns, remembered per user through useListingColumnPreferences (projects.projects.view::quotation-lines).
7. Stock popover stays inside the viewport (Radix collision handling + height capped to the available space, scrolling).
