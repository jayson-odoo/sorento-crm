| AC | Owner point | Criterion |
|---|---|---|
| AC-QLG01 | 1 | The Lines tab of a quotation (form and read view) is the app DataGrid. In edit mode rows reorder by dragging a handle; the order on screen is the order Save stores (array position, as today). |
| AC-QLG02 | 1 | Columns can be resized and reordered by drag; order and widths come back after a reload (column preferences key `projects.projects.view::quotation-lines`). |
| AC-QLG03 | 8 | A section bar is a full-width row that moves with the line it opens. Add a section, the section label and continuous line numbering behave as today. |
| AC-QLG04 | 2 | At a 1280 px viewport with the sidebar open, the grid has no horizontal scroll and no header is truncated. |
| AC-QLG05 | 2 | Photo is a 40 px thumbnail; clicking it opens AttachmentPreviewModal. Lines with no photo show today's empty states. |
| AC-QLG06 | 2 (Q1) | A product with no chosen photo and exactly one photo image (any image not typed "Technical Specifications") uses that image as its photo on the quotation screen, PDF and Excel (the readers of `product_image_service`). Several and none chosen: state `not_chosen`. A drawing is never counted as a photo. The brochure already adopts a lone image on its own (`brochure_image_service.adopt_single_candidates`) and is not changed by this lane. |
| AC-QLG07 | 2 (Q1) | When a product has several photos, the editor offers a picker (candidate thumbnails); the pick is stored on the line as `image_attachment_id`, saved with the quotation, and wins over the product's own answer. The product's attachments are not changed. |
| AC-QLG08 | 2 (Q2) | Drawing is a 40 px thumbnail of the line's drawing: the picked one (`drawing_attachment_id`), else the product's first "Technical Specifications" image by upload time. A product with N > 1 drawings shows N on the thumbnail and opens the same picker. No drawing: "no drawing". Custom item: none. |
| AC-QLG09 | 2 (Q2) | The server refuses (422) a photo or drawing id that is not an image attachment of the line's product (drawing: of type "Technical Specifications"), that is deleted, or that is set on a line with no product. An unchanged stored id is not re-checked. |
| AC-QLG10 | 2 (Q2) | Issuing a version fills `drawing_attachment_id` on every product line that has none (fill only, never overwrite), exactly like the photo. A later change to the product's drawings does not change a re-download of that issue. A revision copies both ids. |
| AC-QLG11 | 2 (Q2) | The issue PDF and Excel print the line's drawing image in TECHNICAL SPEC. Typed tech-spec text, where a line still has some, prints under the description. The typed Tech spec box is gone from the grid. |
| AC-QLG12 | 3 (Q3) | A line with no product shows the badge "Custom item"; the picker placeholder is "Pick a product"; the error (screen and 422) is "A custom item needs a description". "Off-catalog" appears nowhere on the quotation screens. |
| AC-QLG13 | 4 | Brand is a clearable SearchableSelect over the brands master. Picking a product still fills it. The saved value is the brand name. |
| AC-QLG14 | 5 | Description is a multi-line box that grows with its text; line breaks survive Save, the read view, the PDF and the Excel. |
| AC-QLG15 | 6 (Q5) | Each product line shows a stock chip with Available for the chosen group (on hand - SO qty + SPO qty, the stock-detail rule). Green when it covers the quoted qty, amber when 0 < Available < qty, red at 0 or below. A custom item shows no chip. |
| AC-QLG16 | 6 | Clicking the chip opens a read-only popover built from the existing stock components (`useStockDetail` + `CellStockTable`): the group's locations with subtotal, then the site pools, then incoming SPOs. Numbers equal the stock-detail endpoint for the same product and group. |
| AC-QLG17 | 6 (Q5) | A "Stock at" dropdown on the Lines tab lists the fulfilment-planning groups; the choice is remembered in the browser and survives a reload. |
| AC-QLG18 | 7 (Q4) | No "Counts per" column. Line details (row menu) holds Complete set, "Priced per" (Each house unit / Each bathroom / Each facility / Whole site (common area), empty = Not set) and Notes. No grid cell wraps a select onto two rows. |
| AC-QLG19 | 8 | Rate only is a tick under the line total; a rate-only line shows "rate only" and is left out of the scope total (as today). |
| AC-QLG20 | - | Unchanged: one Save for every scope, staged remove with Restore, search hides rows without renumbering, below-floor and non-standard badges, frozen and issued versions read-only (no picker, no drag). |
| AC-QLG21 | - | At 375 px the page does not scroll sideways; only the grid scrolls inside its card. |
