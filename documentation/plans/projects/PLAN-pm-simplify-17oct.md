# PLAN: simplify the project PO and delivery schedule parts (PM-SIMPLIFY)

Status: BUILT, in review (20 Oct 2026). Mock v2 approved by the owner; Q1, Q2 and Q3 built as
the recommended (a) (crew to correct if the owner picked otherwise); Q4 and Q5 (a) as answered.
Track: full (Q2 changes a business rule; diff well over 300 lines; no migration). Build notes and
deviations: section "Build (20 Oct)" at the bottom.

Owner 15 Oct: "the PO part and the delivery schedule part are badly designed, too complicated ->
simplify." This is a new round on top of the shipped 24 Sep redesign
(`PLAN-po-schedule-redesign-24sep.md`, slices S1-S7, #1219 #1237 #1264 #1265, later #1618 #1681).

## Steps

1. Discovery: walk create PO from a project, plan and change delivery dates, partial deliveries,
   see what is outstanding. Count screens, clicks and fields per job, screenshot every step.
2. Proposal: fewer steps and screens, existing components only. Mock v1 on the real case with an
   element -> component map (repo paths), at most 5 questions, one report to the owner.
3. After the owner OKs the mock: behaviour card if rules change, red-first tests, reviewer,
   security review, browser pass, hand-test script.

## Discovery findings (code walk, 17 Oct; browser walk with step counts follows)

FE root `sorento_crm_frontend/app/(protected)/project-sales/[projectId]` (P below), BE root
`sorento_crm_backend/app`.

### Where the work lives today

- Project detail has 12 tabs (`P/components/ProjectDetailClient.tsx:77-90`); PO, schedule and SO
  work sits on three of them (POs, Delivery schedules, Sales orders).
- One PO end to end visits those 3 tabs plus 4 pages: PO record `P/pos/[poId]`, PO review
  `P/purchase-orders/[versionId]`, schedule review `P/delivery-schedules/[versionId]`, sales
  order `P/sales-orders/[psoId]` (and its /worksheet, /revisions, /divergence sub-pages).

### Jobs, as the code runs them

1. **Create a PO (scan).** POs tab -> Upload a PO document (2 fields) -> PO review page, wait
   for extraction -> fix lines (7 editable columns) -> act on each handwritten note -> Confirm ->
   Approve -> Countersign (a second user). Three sign-offs on one screen
   (`P/components/POIntakeConfirmClient.tsx:215-233`, `BE/api/v1/projects/po_intake.py:329,366,387`).
   By hand: Record a PO (7 fields, `PurchaseOrderDialog.tsx:131-221`) then Edit the PO lines
   (8-column editor) on the PO record page.
2. **Plan delivery dates.** Delivery schedules tab -> Upload a schedule (4-6 fields,
   `DeliveryScheduleUploadDialog.tsx:160-262`) -> review matrix -> fix cells / resolve or dismiss
   columns -> Confirm (dialog, "Confirm anyway" + reason when anything is unreconciled).
3. **Change delivery dates.** Dates are read-only on the matrix
   (`DeliveryScheduleMatrix.tsx:233-239`). Three different routes, three different stores:
   upload a whole new version (`delivery_phases.delivery_date`), accept a re-date proposal in the
   History sheet (`delivery_schedule_cells.delivery_date_override`,
   `BE/services/project_schedule_service.py:2330`), or edit `delivery_date` on SO lines
   (`SalesOrderLinesEditor.tsx:273`), which never flows back. Published SOs then go through
   Revisions -> Compare -> Create the amendment (dialog) -> decide rows -> Publish the amendment.
4. **Partial deliveries.** No delivery is recorded on the project at all. Splitting happens
   when sales orders are built (Build drafts dialog + second confirm,
   `SalesOrderBuildDialog.tsx:92-202`): each PO line is spread over schedule phases into SO lines.
   Delivered quantities exist only on core `sales_order_lines.qty_delivered` (AutoCount sync,
   `BE/models/order.py:759-764`).
5. **See what is outstanding.** No project screen shows ordered vs scheduled vs delivered per
   item. Only Stock debt and Fulfilment planning read delivered quantities, keyed by product/SO,
   outside the project.

### Defects found on the way (verified against the code)

- D1. Two editing surfaces for a scanned PO's lines; only one reaches the sales orders. The
  build reads `po_lines` whenever a PO version exists
  (`BE/services/project_so_draft_service.py:577-602`); hand edits to `purchase_order_lines` are
  used only without a scan (`:604-627`) and confirming a new version deletes and rewrites them
  (`BE/services/project_po_confirm.py:246-247`).
- D2. Approve and Countersign gate nothing: no reader of the approval stamps in the build or
  publish path (grep of `approved_at` in `project_so_draft_service.py` and
  `api/v1/projects/sales_orders.py` is empty), though `po_intake.py:372` says CS cannot open the
  draft before approval.
- D3. A sales order can be built from an unconfirmed schedule version: `build` never checks
  `confirmed_at`; the build dialog lists "Not confirmed yet" versions. The PO version picked
  also falls back to an unconfirmed one (`project_so_draft_service.py:571-575`).
- D4. The next-step card links `?tab=pos&po=`, `?tab=schedules&po=`, `?tab=sales-orders&build=`
  (`POToSalesOrderStep.tsx:76-81`) but only `tab` is read (`ProjectDetailClient.tsx:98`), so the
  user re-picks the PO in the next dialog.
- D5. The PO is re-picked in the schedule upload, the build dialog and the amendment picker.

### Data model, for reference

Four line sets describe one order: `po_lines` (scan, per version), `purchase_order_lines`
(agreed/keyed), `delivery_schedule_cells` (product x phase), project `sales_order_lines`
(product x phase x date). Delivery dates live in three places: `delivery_phases.delivery_date`,
`delivery_schedule_cells.delivery_date_override`, `sales_order_lines.delivery_date`.

## Discovery findings (browser walk, 17 Oct)

Sandbox copy, synthetic project "Taman Contoh Residences" (12 PO lines, schedule v1 + v2 over
6 phases in two areas, 6 sales orders, PSO-000001 published with 3 lines part delivered).
Sidebar clicks from `/`. Screenshots: `evidence/pm-simplify-17oct/` (a = create a PO, b = change
dates, c = partial deliveries, d = what is outstanding; `-1280` and `-375`).

| Job | Today |
| --- | --- |
| A. Create a PO | 3 pages (project, PO record, PO document review) + 2 dialogs (Upload: 2 fields, Record: 7 fields), 10 clicks, 3 sign-offs (Confirm, Approve, Countersign) (a01-a09) |
| B. Change one delivery date | Not possible on the schedule: dates are column headers, clicking does nothing; History sheet read-only (b04-b07). Only route seen: the delivery date on every draft SO line for that area, one SO at a time; published SOs locked (b08). Or upload a revision: 5-field dialog (b02), review, confirm |
| C. Partial deliveries | Shown nowhere: SO lines have Qty, UOM, Unit price, Amount, Delivery (date); no delivered figure (c04). Build drafts: 2 dialogs, 3 fields (c02, c03) |
| D. Ordered / scheduled / delivered / outstanding per item | 7 screens, about 15 clicks; ordered and scheduled found on two different pages, compared by eye; delivered and outstanding not obtainable (d01-d04) |

Also seen: schedule v2 "Need attention (0)" filter beside a "Needs acknowledgement 1" flag (b04);
PO review says "Only 0 of 1 pages were read" on a confirmed PO with all 12 lines (a09); product
not resolved shows as "Not matched", "Not quoted", "Not identified" and "Not resolved" on four
screens; PO line UOM "NOS" becomes "UNIT" on the SO line (b08).

## Proposal (mock v1)

Mock: `mockups/po-schedule-simplify-v1.html` (1280 and 375 frames, numbered callouts, element to
component map, existing components only).

1. One **Orders** tab on the project replaces POs, Delivery schedules and Sales orders (12 tabs to
   10). Grid of POs; a row expands to its schedule and sales orders; right-click for the row's
   actions; Columns toggle.
2. One **PO page** (`pos/[poId]`) replaces the PO record, the PO document review and the schedule
   review pages. Line tabs: Lines, Deliveries, Sales orders, Documents. One header CTA: the next
   step.
3. **Lines tab**: Ordered, Scheduled, Delivered, Outstanding per line, from existing data (no
   migration: `projects.sales_order_lines.source_po_line_id` + `core_sales_order_line_id` ->
   `public.sales_order_lines.qty_delivered` via `delivered_qty_of`,
   `BE/services/project_supply_service.py:532`). Expand a line for its deliveries.
4. **Deliveries tab**: one row per phase; the date is edited in place and draft SO lines on that
   phase follow; a published SO gets the existing amendment flow (Q2). Upload revised schedule is
   one field.
5. One sign-off (Q1). Build in one dialog with one field (Q5). Defects D1-D5 fixed on the way.

| Job | Today | Proposed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create a PO from a scan | 3 pages + 2 dialogs, 10 clicks, 3 sign-offs | 1 page + 1 dialog, 3 clicks, 1 sign-off |
| Change one delivery's date | not possible on the schedule | 2 clicks, 1 field |
| Upload a revised schedule | 5 fields | 1 field |
| See a partial delivery | shown nowhere | 0 extra clicks |
| Outstanding per item | 7 screens, ~15 clicks, not answerable | 1 screen, 2 clicks |
| Build sales orders | 2 dialogs, 3 fields | 1 dialog, 1 field |

## Questions for the owner

- Q1. Approve + Countersign gate nothing: (a) drop them, Confirm is the only sign-off; (b) keep and
  make Build wait for Countersign. Recommendation (a).
- Q2. Change a delivery date: (a) edit in place, draft SOs follow, published get an amendment;
  (b) only via a revised schedule upload. Recommendation (a).
- Q3. One page per PO (merge the three pages)? Recommendation yes.
- Q4. Delivered quantities: (a) AutoCount only, read-only; (b) also recorded in the CRM.
  **Answered (crew, 17 Oct): (a).** Owner rule: AutoCount is the source of truth.
- Q5. Build: (a) keep the split-by choice in one dialog; (b) always split by delivery date, no
  dialog. **Answered (crew, 17 Oct): (a)**, no behaviour removed.

Crew, 17 Oct: Q1, Q2 and Q3 go to the owner with the mock refilled on the real project case
(masked rows from the crew-data-request). Defects D1-D5 are fixed in the build regardless.

UAC draft: `pm-simplify-17oct-acceptance-criteria.md`. UI word for a schedule row is "Area" (24 Sep ruling J6); "phase" below is the code name (`delivery_phases`).

Track (once approved): full track. Q2 changes a business rule (behaviour card), and the merged
PO page is well over 300 lines; no migration expected.

## Mock v2: the real project case (17 Oct)

`mockups/po-schedule-simplify-v2.html`, built by `mockups/po-schedule-simplify-gen/` from crew's masked
rows of PRJ-000001 (loaded only into a sandbox database; the rows are not in the repo). What the real
case adds over the synthetic one:

- 50 live PO lines (51 printed, 1 cancelled), 15 delivery areas (12 tower, 3 common area with no
  label, shown as Part 1 to 3), 3 sales orders, all blocked, nothing published or delivered.
- The same product sits on several PO lines, so schedule units are shared out over those lines in
  line order before comparing; 20 lines come out short on the schedule and 2 over, and 3 schedule
  columns (2,733 units) match no product. This agrees with the confirmed version's 35 of 44
  columns reconciled.
- **240 of 258 sales order lines carry a delivery date that no longer matches their area's
  confirmed date.** The sales orders were built from schedule v1; v2 (confirmed 19 Aug) moved every
  tower date by about six months and nothing carried the new dates over. This is defect D6, and the
  case for Q2: a date belongs to the area, and draft sales order lines follow it.

## Build (20 Oct)

What shipped, by acceptance criterion (UAC file alongside):

- AC-O1/O2/O3: one Orders tab (`ProjectDetailClient.tsx`, old `?tab=pos|schedules|sales-orders`
  links open it). PO grid gains Delivered (x of y), Next delivery, Next step, a caret that expands
  to the PO's schedule and sales orders, a right-click menu (Open, Upload delivery schedule,
  Upload a new PO version, Copy PO number) and the Columns toggle. The list row carries
  `ordered_units`, `delivered_units`, `next_delivery_date`, `has_document`.
- AC-P1/P2: the PO page has four line tabs (Lines, Deliveries, Sales orders, Documents) and one
  header button that is the next step (`poNextStep.ts`). Edit and the uploads sit behind the gear.
- AC-P3 (Q1a): `POST /purchase-orders/{id}/approve` and `/countersign` removed with their service
  methods; old stamps stay readable on the version.
- AC-P4 (D1): hand line edits on a PO that came from a document are refused (409
  `po_lines_from_document`); Edit then covers the header only.
- AC-P5 (D3): build refuses an unconfirmed schedule version (409 `schedule_not_confirmed`) and a
  scanned PO with no confirmed version (409 `po_not_confirmed`); it never reads an unconfirmed PO
  version.
- AC-L1/L2/L3: `GET /purchase-orders/{id}/progress` and the Lines tab grid (filters "Still to
  deliver", "Schedule differs", amber rows, expand to deliveries, cards at 375).
- AC-D1 to D4 (Q2a, D6): `PUT /delivery-phases/{id}/date` writes the area date and every draft
  sales order line on it in one transaction, proposes an amendment (with its OCN) for each
  published order, names adopted orders as refused, and returns the previous per-line dates for
  Undo. Deliveries tab: date edited in place, toast with Undo, Upload revised schedule asks only
  for the file.
- AC-B1 (Q5a): Build sales orders is one dialog; from the PO page split by is its only field.

Deviations, for the owner to accept or send back:

- **Review pages kept, not merged.** The PO document review (`purchase-orders/[versionId]`) and
  the schedule review (`delivery-schedules/[versionId]`) still exist: they hold the side-by-side
  document viewer and the per-column corrections. The PO page's "Confirm PO" / "Confirm schedule"
  button opens them and they return to the PO page. AC-P1's redirect is therefore not built.
- **No drag sort on the Lines grid.** The grid is read-only progress; it sorts by any column
  instead. Rows on the sales order editor keep their drag sort.
- **"Publish N sales orders"** opens the PO's Sales orders tab, where each order is published as
  today; there is no bulk publish endpoint and none was added.
