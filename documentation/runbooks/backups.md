# Runbook: verified database backups (HA-BACKUP-CHECK)

Owner-run. Nothing in the repo touches prod. Plan:
`documentation/plans/ops/PLAN-ha-backup-check-14oct.md`.

Today the CRM box runs `/opt/sorento-crm2/backup-db.sh` from root cron at 03:00: pg_dump, gzip,
`gzip -t`, `rclone copy` to `gdrive:db-backups/`, delete the local copy, prune Drive. That script
is not in git, nobody hears when it fails, and nobody has restored from it.

This runbook swaps it for two scripts from the repo:

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/ops/backup-db.sh` | Same backup, plus a Healthchecks.io alarm, an overlap lock, log lines, exit codes, and optional `age` encryption (off by default) |
| `scripts/ops/restore-test.sh` | Downloads the newest dump from Drive, restores it into a throwaway container with no network, counts rows, alarms on failure, removes the container. Never touches the live DB; nothing leaves the box |

The same two scripts serve the n8n box and the shared-service box; only the env file differs.

## Placeholders

Never write the real values into the repo, a PR or a comment.

| Placeholder | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `<CRM_ORIGIN>` | the CRM box (the address you SSH to) |
| `<N8N_HOST>` | the n8n box |
| `<SS_HOST>` | the shared-service box |
| `<DB_CONTAINER>` | the Postgres container name on that box (`docker ps --format '{{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}' \| grep -i postgres`) |
| `<DB_USER>`, `<DB_NAME>` | the role and database the old script dumps |
| `<HC_BACKUP_URL>` | the Healthchecks.io ping URL of that box's backup check (`https://hc-ping.com/<uuid>`) |
| `<HC_RESTORE_URL>` | the ping URL of that box's restore-test check |

The ping URLs are secrets in the sense that anyone holding one can mark a check green. They live
only in the env file on the box (mode 600).

## Exit codes (both scripts)

| Code | backup-db.sh | restore-test.sh |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | ok | ok |
| 2 | bad config, or env file not root-only | bad config, env file or work dir not root-only, deploy lock folder group/other writable or lock file missing (step 0b), or encrypted dump without `AGE_IDENTITY` |
| 3 | pg_dump failed | no dump on Drive, download or gzip check failed |
| 4 | `gzip -t` failed | throwaway container did not start or never got ready, or not enough disk free on the work dir or the docker root (the larger of 4x the gzipped dump and 2x its plain SQL) |
| 5 | `age` failed | restore failed (psql prints the line) |
| 6 | rclone upload failed | a sanity table is empty, or a count failed |
| 7 | prune failed (today's upload is on Drive) | a deploy held the deploy lock for 60 min; nothing was restored |
| 75 | another run holds the lock; skipped, no ping | same |

Every non-zero code except 75 pings `/fail`.

## Step 0. Healthchecks.io (5 min, from your laptop)

1. Sign in at healthchecks.io (free plan is enough), project "Sorento backups".
2. Add one check per box per job. Name, schedule, grace:
   - `crm-backup`: Cron `0 3 * * *`, time zone = the box's cron time zone (`timedatectl` on the box), grace 2 hours.
   - `crm-restore-test`: Cron `30 4 * * 0`, same time zone, grace 6 hours.
   - Later, the same pair for n8n and shared-service (steps 6 and 7).
3. Integrations: email to you (and WhatsApp or Telegram if you want the page on your phone).
4. Copy each check's ping URL. It goes into the box's env file in step 2.

- Check: each check shows "New" (never pinged).
- Rollback: delete the checks. Nothing on the boxes depends on them existing.

### Step 0b. Where the deploy lock lives (CRM box, 5 min)

The restore test and the release script (`blue_green_deploy.sh`, lane HA-MEM-DEPLOY-GUARD) share one
lock file, named by the env var `DEPLOY_LOCK_PATH` in both, default `/opt/sorento-crm2/.deploy.lock`.
A root process must not open files in a folder another account can write, so first look at who owns
that folder and who the release job logs in as:

```bash
ssh root@<CRM_ORIGIN>
stat -c '%U %G %a' /opt/sorento-crm2
last -n 50 | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c   # who logs in; the release job is the GitHub secret SSH_USER
```

- **(a) It prints `root root 755` (or `root <group> 755`, `750`, `700`): no group or other write bit.**
  Keep the default. Nothing to set. Use `<LOCK_DIR>` = `/opt/sorento-crm2` below.
  (The repo cannot tell who `SSH_USER` is: its value is a secret. `last` shows which accounts log in;
  if one besides `root` owns or can write the folder, that is option (b).)
- **(b) It prints another owner, or a mode with a group or other write bit (`775`, `777`).**
  Use a separate folder, once:

  ```bash
  sudo install -d -o <release user> -g root -m 755 /var/lib/sorento-deploy
  sudo install -m 644 -o <release user> -g root /dev/null /var/lib/sorento-deploy/.deploy.lock
  ```

  Then set `DEPLOY_LOCK_PATH=/var/lib/sorento-deploy/.deploy.lock` in BOTH the restore-test env
  (`/etc/sorento-backup/backup.env`, step 2) and the deploy env (the env HA-MEM-DEPLOY-GUARD's
  runbook names). Use `<LOCK_DIR>` = `/var/lib/sorento-deploy` below. The release user owning the
  folder is fine: it runs `docker compose`, which is root-equivalent on the box already. The restore
  test checks that: a lock folder owned by anyone but root or a `docker` group member is refused
  (exit 2). `id -nG <release user>` must list `docker` (or the release user is root).

- Check: `stat -c '%U %G %a' <LOCK_DIR>` ends in `755`, `750` or `700` (no group or other write bit), and `ls -l <LOCK_DIR>/.deploy.lock` shows `-rw-r--r--`.
- Rollback (b only): `sudo rm -rf /var/lib/sorento-deploy` and remove `DEPLOY_LOCK_PATH` from both envs.

## Step 1. Read the old script on the CRM box (read-only, 5 min)

```bash
ssh root@<CRM_ORIGIN>
sudo crontab -l | grep -n backup
sudo cat /opt/sorento-crm2/backup-db.sh
rclone listremotes
rclone lsf gdrive:db-backups | sort | tail -n 5
docker ps --format '{{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}' | grep -iE 'postgres|pgvector'
df -h / /var/lib/docker
```

Write down, for step 2:

- the `pg_dump` line: is it `docker exec <container> pg_dump -U <user> <db>` or a host `pg_dump`?
  Any extra flags (`--no-owner`, `-Fc`, `--exclude-table`)? The new script runs plain
  `pg_dump -U <DB_USER> <DB_NAME>` piped to gzip. If the old line has extra flags, stop and tell crew.
- `RETENTION_DAYS` and the rclone remote and folder (expected `gdrive:db-backups`).
- the file name pattern of the newest dumps on Drive. New dumps are named
  `sorento_crm_<YYYYMMDD>T<HHMMSS>Z.sql.gz`, and both prune and restore test only look at
  `<BACKUP_NAME>_<YYYYMMDD>T<HHMMSS>Z.sql.gz`. Old files with another name are never pruned by the new script; delete them by
  hand once `RETENTION_DAYS` of new dumps exist (step 8).
- the Postgres image tag (`postgres:17...` or `pgvector/pgvector:pg17`). The restore test reads the
  major version from the dump itself, so this is only a cross-check.
- free disk and memory: the restore test refuses to start (exit 4) unless both the work dir
  (`/var/lib`) and the docker root (`docker info --format '{{.DockerRootDir}}'`) have free at least
  the larger of 4x the gzipped dump and 2x the plain SQL inside it (a restored DB with its indexes is
  about 1-2x the plain SQL, and a dump compresses 3-8x). They usually sit on the same disk as live
  Postgres. To see now whether it will pass:
  `df -h /var/lib "$(docker info --format '{{.DockerRootDir}}')"` and
  `rclone cat "gdrive:db-backups/$(rclone lsf gdrive:db-backups | grep '^sorento_crm_.*\.sql\.gz$' | sort | tail -n 1)" | gzip -dc | wc -c`
  (the plain SQL size in bytes).
  The throwaway container is capped at 2 GB of memory (`RESTORE_MEMORY`), so `free -g` must show
  that much available at 04:30 on a Sunday without squeezing live Postgres.
- the deploy lock folder: done in step 0b; note whether you took (a) or (b).

- Check: you have every value above. If `rclone lsf` errors, the Drive token is broken today:
  `rclone config reconnect gdrive:` first (it prints a URL; finish it from your laptop).
- Rollback: nothing changed.

## Step 2. Install the scripts on the CRM box (10 min)

From your laptop, in the repo checkout on `main` after this PR merges:

```bash
ssh root@<CRM_ORIGIN> 'mkdir -p /opt/sorento-backup /etc/sorento-backup && chmod 700 /etc/sorento-backup'
scp scripts/ops/backup-db.sh scripts/ops/restore-test.sh root@<CRM_ORIGIN>:/opt/sorento-backup/
ssh root@<CRM_ORIGIN> 'chmod 750 /opt/sorento-backup/*.sh && command -v flock gzip curl rclone docker'
ssh root@<CRM_ORIGIN> 'test -e /opt/sorento-crm2/.deploy.lock || install -m 644 -o root -g root /dev/null /opt/sorento-crm2/.deploy.lock; ls -l /opt/sorento-crm2/.deploy.lock'
```

The last line is for step 0b option (a) only: it creates the deploy lock file the restore test
shares with the release script (the script never creates it). It must print
`-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0`. With option (b) the file already exists in `/var/lib/sorento-deploy`.

On the box, write the env file (fill the values from step 1):

```bash
sudo tee /etc/sorento-backup/backup.env >/dev/null <<'EOF'
BACKUP_NAME=sorento_crm
DB_CONTAINER=<DB_CONTAINER>
DB_USER=<DB_USER>
DB_NAME=<DB_NAME>
RCLONE_DEST=gdrive:db-backups
RETENTION_DAYS=<same as the old script>
HC_BACKUP_URL=<HC_BACKUP_URL>
HC_RESTORE_URL=<HC_RESTORE_URL>
# restore test: role the dump objects belong to, plus any role named in GRANT lines (step 4)
RESTORE_DB_USER=<DB_USER>
RESTORE_ROLES=""
SANITY_TABLES="users customers orders products audit_logs"
SANITY_LATEST=audit_logs.changed_at
# Step 0b option (b) only, and the same line in the deploy env:
# DEPLOY_LOCK_PATH=/var/lib/sorento-deploy/.deploy.lock
EOF
sudo chmod 600 /etc/sorento-backup/backup.env
```

The file is read as shell code: a value with spaces needs double quotes, as above. Both scripts
refuse to read it (exit 2) unless it is owned by root and not writable by group or others.

`rclone` reads its config from root's home (`/root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`), so run both
scripts as root, as the old cron does.

- Check: `sudo ls -l /etc/sorento-backup/backup.env` shows `-rw-------  root root`.
- Rollback: `sudo rm -rf /opt/sorento-backup /etc/sorento-backup /var/lib/sorento-backup /var/lib/sorento-restore-test`.

## Step 3. First backup by hand, then switch cron (10 min)

```bash
sudo /opt/sorento-backup/backup-db.sh; echo "exit=$?"
rclone lsf gdrive:db-backups | sort | tail -n 3
```

- Check: `exit=0`, the last log line is `done`, a new `sorento_crm_<stamp>.sql.gz` is on Drive, and
  `crm-backup` on Healthchecks.io is green. No `.sql.gz` is left in `/var/backups/sorento-db`.

Switch cron (keep the old line commented, so rollback is one edit):

```bash
sudo crontab -l > /root/crontab.bak.$(date +%F)
sudo crontab -e
```

Comment out the old line and add the new pair:

```
# 0 3 * * * /opt/sorento-crm2/backup-db.sh ...   <- old line, keep it commented
0 3 * * * umask 077; /opt/sorento-backup/backup-db.sh >> /var/log/sorento-backup.log 2>&1
30 4 * * 0 umask 077; /opt/sorento-backup/restore-test.sh >> /var/log/sorento-restore-test.log 2>&1
```

Add log rotation. The logs are root-only: a failed restore can print a row of customer data.

```bash
sudo touch /var/log/sorento-backup.log /var/log/sorento-restore-test.log
sudo chmod 600 /var/log/sorento-backup.log /var/log/sorento-restore-test.log
sudo tee /etc/logrotate.d/sorento-backup >/dev/null <<'EOF'
/var/log/sorento-backup.log /var/log/sorento-restore-test.log {
  monthly
  rotate 6
  compress
  create 0600 root root
  missingok
  notifempty
}
EOF
```

- Check: the next morning `tail -n 8 /var/log/sorento-backup.log` ends with `done`, and
  Healthchecks.io shows the 03:00 ping.
- Rollback: `sudo crontab /root/crontab.bak.<date>` (puts the old script back exactly).

### The Sunday restore window

**No deploys between 04:30 and 06:00 on Sundays** (the restore-test window; later if step 7 adds
more restore lines). The box has 16 GB and on 10 Sep the kernel OOM-killed live Postgres, so the
restore test is built to lose any fight for resources:

- the throwaway container is capped at 2 GB memory and 2 GB memory+swap (`RESTORE_MEMORY`), 1 CPU,
  and has `--oom-score-adj 1000`, so under memory pressure the kernel kills it before anything else;
- decompressing the dump on the host runs at `nice 19` and idle IO priority. The container's own
  Postgres, which does the heavy disk writes, is held back only by the 1 CPU cap: it does not inherit
  host priorities. If the Sunday window ever slows live traffic, tell crew (a per-device write cap,
  `--device-write-bps`, is the next step);
- it takes a **shared** lock on `DEPLOY_LOCK_PATH` (step 0b). Once lane HA-MEM-DEPLOY-GUARD
  makes `blue_green_deploy.sh` take the same lock exclusively, a deploy waits for a running restore
  test, and a restore test waits up to 60 min for a running deploy, then gives up (exit 7, `/fail`).
  Until that lane is merged the lock does not stop a deploy, so the rule above is the only guard.

- Check: during a run, `docker inspect $(docker ps -q --filter name=restore-test-) --format
  '{{.HostConfig.Memory}} {{.HostConfig.OomScoreAdj}} {{.HostConfig.NanoCpus}}'` prints
  `2147483648 1000 1000000000`.
- Rollback: none needed. To pause restore tests (for example a long maintenance), comment out the
  `restore-test.sh` cron line and pause the Healthchecks check.

## Step 4. First restore test by hand (20 min)

```bash
sudo /opt/sorento-backup/restore-test.sh; echo "exit=$?"
docker ps -a --filter name=restore-test- --format '{{.Names}}'
```

The first run pulls `pgvector/pgvector:pg<major>` (about 160 MB).

- Check: `exit=0`; the log shows `rows users=<n>` and the other tables with plausible numbers (compare
  with the CRM screens), `latest audit_logs.changed_at=` within the last day, and
  `done: ... restores cleanly`. Above those: `deploy lock held (shared): <LOCK_DIR>/.deploy.lock` and two `disk ok` lines. The
  `docker ps -a` line prints nothing. `crm-restore-test` is green.
- If it fails with exit 4 and `only <n> bytes free on <dir>`: free disk on that filesystem. The
  docker root is the one that matters (the restored DB lands there). Never lower
  `RESTORE_DISK_FACTOR` on the CRM box: the restored DB shares the disk with live Postgres.
- If it fails with exit 2 and `... is a symlink or writable by group or others. Follow runbook step 0
  option (b)`: do what the message says (step 0b option (b)). If it says `.deploy.lock is missing`:
  redo step 0b and step 2's last line.
- If it fails with `ERROR: role "<x>" does not exist`: add `<x>` to `RESTORE_ROLES` in the env file
  and run again. To list every role the dump needs at once:

  ```bash
  F=$(rclone lsf gdrive:db-backups | grep '^sorento_crm_.*\.sql\.gz$' | sort | tail -n 1)
  rclone cat "gdrive:db-backups/$F" | gzip -dc \
    | grep -E '^(ALTER .* OWNER TO|GRANT |REVOKE |ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES )' \
    | sed -E 's/;$//; s/.*FOR ROLE ([^ ]+) .* (TO|FROM) (.*)/\1,\3/; s/.* (TO|FROM) //' \
    | tr ',' '\n' | tr -d ' "' | sort -u
  ```

  Leave out `<DB_USER>` and `PUBLIC`; the rest go in `RESTORE_ROLES` (space separated). A role
  name with capitals or other characters than `a-z 0-9 _` is refused by the script: tell crew.
- If it fails with `extension "<x>" is not available`: tell crew (the throwaway image is
  `pgvector/pgvector`, which ships pgvector and the contrib extensions only).
- Rollback: nothing to roll back; the live DB is never touched. A container left behind by a killed
  run: `docker rm -f -v $(docker ps -aq --filter name=restore-test-)`.

## Step 5. Encryption (optional, default OFF, owner decision)

Dumps on Drive are plain gzip today: anyone with access to that Google account can read every
customer row. `age` encryption fixes that. The box holds only the public key; the private key stays
offline with you, so a stolen box or Drive token cannot read old dumps. The cost: restoring, and the
weekly restore test, need the private key.

To switch on:

1. On your laptop: `age-keygen -o sorento-backup.agekey`. Store the file in your password manager
   and on paper or a second offline device. Losing it makes every encrypted dump unreadable.
2. Copy the `# public key: age1...` line from that file.
3. On the box: `sudo apt install -y age`, then add to `/etc/sorento-backup/backup.env`:

   ```
   BACKUP_ENCRYPT=age
   AGE_RECIPIENT=age1...
   ```

4. Run `sudo /opt/sorento-backup/backup-db.sh` and check the new file ends in `.sql.gz.age`.

The weekly restore test then fails with exit 2 ("is encrypted; set AGE_IDENTITY") unless the box has
the private key. Pick one:

- (a) keep the key off the box and run the restore test only in the monthly drill, with the key
  held in memory for that run only: on the box `install -d -m 700 /dev/shm/sorento-drill`, `scp` the
  key into that folder, run with `AGE_IDENTITY=/dev/shm/sorento-drill/drill.agekey`, then
  `rm -rf /dev/shm/sorento-drill` (`/dev/shm` never hits disk), and
  remove the weekly restore-test cron line and its Healthchecks check; or
- (b) put the key on the box (`/etc/sorento-backup/restore.agekey`, mode 600) and set
  `AGE_IDENTITY` in the env file. Weaker: the box can then read old dumps, but Drive alone cannot.

- Check: `rclone cat gdrive:db-backups/<newest> | head -c 22` prints `age-encryption.org/v1`.
- Rollback: remove the two lines from the env file. Old `.age` dumps stay readable with the key.

## Step 6. n8n box (check first, then same pattern)

Check on the box before installing anything:

```bash
ssh root@<N8N_HOST>
docker ps --format '{{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}'
docker inspect <n8n container> --format '{{range .Config.Env}}{{println .}}{{end}}' | grep -E '^DB_TYPE|^DB_POSTGRESDB_(DATABASE|USER)'
rclone listremotes; sudo crontab -l
```

- `DB_TYPE=postgresdb`: same pattern. Env file `/etc/sorento-backup/backup.env` with
  `BACKUP_NAME=n8n`, `RCLONE_DEST=gdrive:db-backups/n8n`, the n8n Postgres container, user and DB,
  and for the restore test `SANITY_TABLES="workflow_entity credentials_entity"` and `SANITY_LATEST=`
  (empty: n8n's timestamp columns are camelCase, which the script does not accept). If
  `DB_TABLE_PREFIX` is set, put the prefix in front of both table names.
- No `DB_TYPE`, or `sqlite`: n8n keeps everything in `database.sqlite` in its data volume. These
  scripts do not cover that. Tell crew; the backup is then a `sqlite3 .backup` of that file.
- **Back up `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` separately**, in your password manager: `docker exec <n8n container>
  cat /home/node/.n8n/config` or the compose env. Every n8n credential in the dump is encrypted with
  it; a restored DB without the key has workflows but no working credentials.
- rclone: if `listremotes` has no `gdrive:`, copy the CRM box's `/root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`
  (mode 600) or run `rclone config` there. The `n8n` subfolder keeps prune and restore test apart
  from the CRM's dumps.
- Healthchecks: `n8n-backup` and `n8n-restore-test` checks, as in step 0.
- Then steps 2, 3 and 4 with these values. Use `03:20` for the cron so the boxes do not upload at
  the same minute. The box has no `/opt/sorento-crm2`, so the restore test logs `no deploy lock
  folder ... not waiting for deploys`: expected. Check `free -g` first; if less than 4 GB is
  available, set `RESTORE_MEMORY=1g` in the env file.

- Check: `sudo /opt/sorento-backup/backup-db.sh` ends with `done` and a new
  `n8n_<stamp>Z.sql.gz` is in `gdrive:db-backups/n8n`; `sudo /opt/sorento-backup/restore-test.sh`
  ends with `restores cleanly` and `rows workflow_entity=` matches the workflow count in the n8n
  editor; both n8n checks on Healthchecks.io are green; `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is in the password
  manager.
- Rollback: `sudo crontab /root/crontab.bak.<date>` (or delete the two new cron lines), then
  `sudo rm -rf /opt/sorento-backup /etc/sorento-backup /var/lib/sorento-backup /var/lib/sorento-restore-test`.
  The n8n dumps already on Drive stay; delete `gdrive:db-backups/n8n` by hand if you want them gone.

## Step 7. Shared-service box (check first, then same pattern)

```bash
ssh root@<SS_HOST>
docker ps --format '{{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}' | grep -iE 'postgres|pgvector|mysql|mariadb|mongo'
docker exec <pg container> psql -U <user> -Atc "select datname from pg_database where not datistemplate"
```

- One Postgres DB: same pattern, `BACKUP_NAME=shared`, `RCLONE_DEST=gdrive:db-backups/shared`,
  `SANITY_TABLES="<two or three busiest tables>"` of that service (`\dt+` sorted by size), and
  `SANITY_LATEST=<table>.<created_at column>` or empty.
- Several DBs in one Postgres: one env file per DB (`/etc/sorento-backup/<db>.env`, each with its own
  `BACKUP_NAME`, folder and Healthchecks URLs) and one cron line per DB:
  `20 3 * * * umask 077; BACKUP_ENV_FILE=/etc/sorento-backup/<db>.env /opt/sorento-backup/backup-db.sh >> /var/log/sorento-backup.log 2>&1`.
  and one restore-test line per DB, each its own time so they do not share the box's disk at once:
  `30 4 * * 0 umask 077; BACKUP_ENV_FILE=/etc/sorento-backup/<db>.env /opt/sorento-backup/restore-test.sh >> /var/log/sorento-restore-test.log 2>&1`
  (then `30 5`, `30 6` for the next DBs). Running two at once is safe, only slower.
- A non-Postgres store (MySQL, Mongo, a SQLite file): not covered here; tell crew which.
- Healthchecks: one backup and one restore-test check per DB.
- No `/opt/sorento-crm2` here either: `no deploy lock folder` in the restore log is expected. If this
  box has its own deploy, add no deploys during the restore lines' times to that box's routine.

- Check: for every DB, a hand run of both scripts (with `BACKUP_ENV_FILE=/etc/sorento-backup/<db>.env`
  when there are several) ends with `done` and `restores cleanly`, the counts look like that service's
  real data, a new `<BACKUP_NAME>_<stamp>Z.sql.gz` is in its own Drive folder, and its two
  Healthchecks checks are green.
- Rollback: `sudo crontab /root/crontab.bak.<date>` (or delete the new cron lines), then
  `sudo rm -rf /opt/sorento-backup /etc/sorento-backup /var/lib/sorento-backup /var/lib/sorento-restore-test`.
  Dumps already on Drive stay until you delete their folders by hand.

## Step 8. Clean up old-style dumps (after RETENTION_DAYS)

Once Drive holds `RETENTION_DAYS` days of `sorento_crm_<stamp>Z.sql.gz` files and the weekly restore
test has been green twice, delete the old-style files the new prune never matches:

```bash
rclone lsf gdrive:db-backups --max-depth 1 --files-only | grep -v '^sorento_crm_[0-9]\{8\}T[0-9]\{6\}Z'
# review that list, then for each:  rclone deletefile "gdrive:db-backups/<name>"
```

Then `sudo rm /opt/sorento-crm2/backup-db.sh` and the commented cron line.

- Rollback: none needed for the delete; it only removes files older than the retention window.

## Monthly restore drill (15 min, first Monday of the month)

The weekly cron proves a dump restores. The drill proves a human can do it under pressure.

- [ ] Healthchecks.io: every backup check pinged in the last 26 h, every restore-test check in the last 8 days. Nothing red in the last month that nobody looked at.
- [ ] `rclone lsf gdrive:db-backups | sort | tail -n 3` on the CRM box: newest is from this morning.
- [ ] `rclone size --max-depth 1 gdrive:db-backups`: total roughly `RETENTION_DAYS` x one dump (prune works). Pruned dumps sit in the Drive trash for 30 days and still count against the Google quota; check the quota at drive.google.com if it is near full.
- [ ] Run `sudo /opt/sorento-backup/restore-test.sh` by hand on each box. Exit 0.
- [ ] Compare `rows orders=` and `rows customers=` with last month's drill. They only grow.
- [ ] `latest audit_logs.changed_at=` is from the last day.
- [ ] Time the run. Note it here: that is the minimum time to recover the DB.
- [ ] Encryption on: the private key opens this month's dump on your laptop:
      `rclone copy gdrive:db-backups/<newest> . && age -d -i sorento-backup.agekey <newest> | gzip -t`.
- [ ] n8n: `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is still in the password manager and matches the box.
- [ ] `docker ps -a --filter name=restore-test-` prints nothing on every box.
- [ ] No restore test in the last month failed with exit 7 (a deploy in the Sunday window); if one did, find out who deployed.
- [ ] Note the date and result in the ops log.

## Restoring for real (the drill's reason to exist)

Do not restore over the live DB from this runbook. The restore-test container shows the dump is good;
a real recovery (new box, or the live DB is gone) is: stop the backend, worker and pgbouncer,
create an empty database, `gzip -dc <dump> | docker exec -i <DB_CONTAINER> psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1
-U <DB_USER> -d <new db>`, point `DATABASE_URL` at it, start the stack. Ask crew to walk it with you;
it is a separate runbook when it is needed.

## Known gaps (not fixed here)

- RPO is still 24 h: a crash at 02:59 loses a day. Fix is WAL archiving (PITR); trigger it when a
  day of lost orders is no longer acceptable.
- `pg_dump` of one DB does not carry roles or passwords (`pg_dumpall --globals-only`). Recovery
  recreates the roles by hand (the role list from step 4).
- Drive sits in the owner's personal Google account; a lost account loses every backup. Encryption
  (step 5) protects confidentiality, not availability. A second copy elsewhere is a follow-up.
