# Runbook: memory and deploy guards (HA-MEM-DEPLOY-GUARD)

Owner-run. Nothing here is automated, and nothing in the repo touches prod. Plan:
`documentation/plans/deploy/PLAN-deploy-memory-guard-14oct.md`.

Why:

- **10 Sep:** the blue/green overlap pushed the 16 GB CRM box out of memory. With no swap the
  kernel killed a Postgres backend, Postgres crash-recovered, and the pipeline still said success.
- **13 Oct:** a slow migration held a deploy.
- **26 Sep (shared service):** new code ran on the old schema after a failed migration.

What the code now does on every release (no action needed for these):

| Guard | Where | On failure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Exclusive lock on `DEPLOY_LOCK_PATH` (default `/opt/sorento-crm2/.deploy.lock`) for the whole deploy; HA-BACKUP-CHECK's weekly restore test waits on the same variable and default | `scripts/blue_green_deploy.sh` | waits up to 10 min (`DEPLOY_LOCK_WAIT_SECONDS`, default 600), then fails; nothing changed |
| Memory guard: `MemAvailable` must be at least 4500 MB, checked before and after the dump | same | deploy stops; old colour keeps serving |
| Disk check: free space in the snapshot dir at least twice the newest dump and at least 10240 MB | same | deploy stops before the dump |
| Pre-migration snapshot of the database the APP uses (`DEPLOY_DB_NAME`, else the active backend's `DATABASE_URL`; never the db container's own `POSTGRES_DB`). `pg_dump -Fc` must exit 0, the file must start with `PGDMP`, and `pg_restore -l` must list `TABLE DATA public alembic_version` | same | deploy stops before any migration; old colour keeps serving |
| Every number in `.deploy.env` must be a whole number | same | deploy stops; nothing changed |
| Postgres check: db container restarted, replaced, or crash-recovered in place | same, before the nginx swap and at the end | before the swap: new colour stopped, old keeps serving. At the end: the run goes red |
| `lock_timeout` 5s, `statement_timeout` 180s on every migration | `sorento_crm_backend/alembic/env.py` | migration fails, new colour never goes healthy, old keeps serving. **This changes behaviour: see step 9** |
| `blue_green_deploy.sh --preflight` checks all of the above on the box and changes nothing | same | exit 1 and a FAIL line per problem |
| `/health` body names Redis and scheduler state (status code still DB only; a 503 body is `{"status":"unhealthy","database":"down"}`, no error text); `/health/deep` returns 503 when DB, Redis or the scheduler is not OK; both refresh their probes at most once per 10s per process | backend | `/health/deep` is for monitors only |
| `Rollback production` workflow | `.github/workflows/rollback.yml` | see step 7 |

## Placeholders

Never write the real values into the repo, a PR or a comment.

| Placeholder | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `<CRM_ORIGIN>` | the CRM box (SSH in the way you always do) |
| `<CRM_DOMAIN>` | the CRM's public hostname |
| `<PROD_COMPOSE>` | the on-box compose: `/opt/sorento-crm2/docker-compose.yml` |
| `<RELEASED_SHA>` | a full 40-character main commit SHA whose release run succeeded |

All box steps run as the user that GitHub Actions SSHes in as (the deploy user), from
`/opt/sorento-crm2`, unless a block starts with `sudo`.

## When

| Step | When | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0. Deploy lock path (agree it with the restore test) | before the next release | 3 min |
| 1. Find out whether swap was ever applied | before the next release | 2 min |
| 2. Swap 6 GB, swappiness 10 | before the next release | 5 min |
| 3. Run `--preflight`, set `.deploy.env`, time one dump | before the first release with these guards | 15 min |
| 4. `mem_limit` lines in the prod compose | next quiet window | 20 min |
| 5. `SKIP_MIGRATIONS` pass-through (makes rollback work across a migration) | with step 4 | 5 min |
| 6. Point a monitor at `/health/deep` | any time | 10 min |
| 7. Rollback (when needed) | on a bad release | 10 min |
| 8. Restore from a pre-migration snapshot (emergency only) | on a bad migration | 30 min |
| 9. A migration failed on `lock timeout` | on that failure | 10 min |

## 0. Deploy lock path

The deploy and HA-BACKUP-CHECK's weekly restore test take the same exclusive lock, so a restore
never runs during a deploy (that overlap would repeat the 10 Sep OOM). Both read
`DEPLOY_LOCK_PATH`, default `/opt/sorento-crm2/.deploy.lock`. The deploy runs as the deploy user,
so that user must be able to create the file, or open it if the restore test created it first
(a read-only open is enough for the lock).

```bash
ls -ld /opt/sorento-crm2 /opt/sorento-crm2/.deploy.lock 2>&1
```

- **Check:** `/opt/sorento-crm2` is owned by root (or by the deploy user) and not writable by
  anyone else. If so, keep the default and do nothing.
- **If `/opt/sorento-crm2` is not root-owned** (or has a group/other write bit), follow
  `backups.md` step 0b option (b) once; it serves both sides. The same commands:

  ```bash
  sudo install -d -o <DEPLOY_USER> -g root -m 755 /var/lib/sorento-deploy
  sudo install -m 644 -o <DEPLOY_USER> -g root /dev/null /var/lib/sorento-deploy/.deploy.lock
  echo 'DEPLOY_LOCK_PATH=/var/lib/sorento-deploy/.deploy.lock' >> /opt/sorento-crm2/.deploy.env
  ```

  and set the SAME `DEPLOY_LOCK_PATH` in the restore-test env (`/etc/sorento-backup/backup.env`,
  `backups.md` step 2). `<DEPLOY_USER>` is the user GitHub Actions SSHes in as (the
  `SSH_USER` secret); `id -nG <DEPLOY_USER>` must list `docker`, or the restore test refuses the
  lock folder.
- **Check:** run as the deploy user while no deploy runs; it prints `lock-ok`:

  ```bash
  P=$(grep -s '^DEPLOY_LOCK_PATH=' /opt/sorento-crm2/.deploy.env | cut -d= -f2)
  flock -n "${P:-/opt/sorento-crm2/.deploy.lock}" true && echo lock-ok
  ```
- **Rollback:** delete the `DEPLOY_LOCK_PATH` line from `.deploy.env` (the default applies again).

## 1. Is swap already on?

The swap block in `documentation/plans/deploy/PLAN-deploy-memory-and-ci-speed.md` (lines 111-132)
may or may not have been applied.

```bash
swapon --show
free -h
cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
grep -n swapfile /etc/fstab
```

- **Check:** a `/swapfile` line of about 6G in `swapon --show`, swappiness `10`, and an fstab line
  means it is done: skip step 2.
- **Rollback:** nothing to roll back (read-only).

## 2. Swap 6 GB, swappiness 10

Needs about 6 GB free disk: check `df -h /` first (the plan measured 104 of 193 GB used).

```bash
sudo fallocate -l 6G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
grep -q '^/swapfile ' /etc/fstab || echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
sudo sysctl -w vm.swappiness=10
echo 'vm.swappiness=10' | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-swap.conf
```

- **Check:** `swapon --show` lists `/swapfile` at 6G; `cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness` prints `10`;
  `free -h` shows `Swap: 6.0Gi`.
- **Rollback:** `sudo swapoff /swapfile && sudo rm /swapfile`, delete the `/swapfile` line from
  `/etc/fstab`, `sudo rm /etc/sysctl.d/99-swap.conf && sudo sysctl -w vm.swappiness=60`.

Swappiness 10 keeps the app in RAM in normal running; swap only takes the overflow of a spike,
so the box slows down instead of the kernel killing Postgres.

## 3. Preflight, `.deploy.env`, and one timed dump

Run this before the first release that carries these guards, and again after any change on the
box (compose, `.deploy.env`, disk). It checks everything the deploy depends on and **changes
nothing**: no lock file, no snapshot dir, no pull, no container touched.

The script reaches the box only when a release copies it there, so before the first such release
copy it yourself, from your machine, under a different name (the next release overwrites the
real one anyway):

```bash
scp scripts/blue_green_deploy.sh <DEPLOY_USER>@<CRM_ORIGIN>:/opt/sorento-crm2/scripts/blue_green_deploy.sh.new
```

On the box, as the deploy user:

```bash
cd /opt/sorento-crm2
bash scripts/blue_green_deploy.sh.new --preflight; echo "exit=$?"
```

Output is one line per item, then a verdict:

```text
PASS DEPLOY_LOCK_WAIT_SECONDS 600
...
PASS lock             /opt/sorento-crm2/.deploy.lock will be created on the first deploy
PASS db service       db running
PASS db name          <APP_DB> (from DATABASE_URL of backend_blue)
PASS alembic_version  <APP_DB> has alembic_version (1 row(s))
PASS memory           7012 MB available, minimum 4500 MB
PASS disk             88000 MB free for snapshots, need 10240 MB
PASS snapshot dir     backups/pre-migrate will be created with mode 700
==> Preflight PASSED (nothing was changed)
exit=0
```

- **Check:** `exit=0` and no `FAIL` line. A `WARN lock ... held` line means a deploy or the
  restore test is running right now: run it again later.
- **Rollback:** `rm scripts/blue_green_deploy.sh.new` (it changed nothing else).

Fix each `FAIL` in `/opt/sorento-crm2/.deploy.env` (the script sources it; it is not in git):

```bash
cat > /opt/sorento-crm2/.deploy.env <<'KNOBS'
# DB_SERVICE=postgres
# DEPLOY_DB_NAME=<APP_DB>
# DEPLOY_MIN_AVAILABLE_MB=4500
# SNAPSHOT_KEEP_MINUTES=2880
# SNAPSHOT_MIN_FREE_MB=10240
# DEPLOY_LOCK_WAIT_SECONDS=600
# DEPLOY_LOCK_PATH=/opt/sorento-crm2/.deploy.lock
KNOBS
chmod 600 /opt/sorento-crm2/.deploy.env
```

Uncomment only what you change. Never set `IMAGE_TAG` here: it would override the commit CI
deploys. Numbers must be whole numbers without units (`4500`, not `4500MB`): anything else stops
the deploy. Keep `DEPLOY_MIN_AVAILABLE_MB` at 4500 unless step 4's numbers say otherwise.

| FAIL item | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `db service` | `docker compose ps --services`, then `DB_SERVICE=<name>` |
| `db name` | the active backend has no `DATABASE_URL` with a database in it: set `DEPLOY_DB_NAME=<APP_DB>` |
| `alembic_version` | the name resolved, but that database has no `alembic_version` inside the db container. Typical cause: `DATABASE_URL` points at pgbouncer, whose database alias differs from the real name. List the real ones with `docker compose exec -T db sh -c 'psql -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -l'` and set `DEPLOY_DB_NAME` |
| `memory` | see the last paragraph of this step |
| `disk` | free disk, or (accepting the risk) lower `SNAPSHOT_MIN_FREE_MB` |
| `snapshot dir` | `chmod 700 backups/pre-migrate` (owned by the deploy user) |
| `lock` | step 0 |

- **Rollback:** `rm /opt/sorento-crm2/.deploy.env` (the defaults apply again).

Time one dump of the app's database (`<APP_DB>` is the `db name` line above), so you know what a
release now costs. The SSH step allows 100 min in total: the worker's 60 min stop grace, up to 10
min waiting on the deploy lock, and the rest.

```bash
cd /opt/sorento-crm2
df -h .
# Customer data: owner-only file, in the deploy's own 700 directory, removed right after.
mkdir -p backups/pre-migrate && chmod 700 backups/pre-migrate
(umask 077; time docker compose exec -T -e DUMP_DB=<APP_DB> db sh -c 'pg_dump -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$DUMP_DB" -Fc' > backups/pre-migrate/dump-check.tmp)
ls -lh backups/pre-migrate/dump-check.tmp
docker compose exec -T db sh -c 'pg_restore -l; cat > /dev/null' < backups/pre-migrate/dump-check.tmp | grep 'TABLE DATA public alembic_version'
rm backups/pre-migrate/dump-check.tmp
```

- **Check:** the dump finishes in under 10 minutes, the `grep` prints one
  `TABLE DATA public alembic_version` line, and `df` shows more than twice the dump's size plus
  10 GB free. If the dump takes longer, tell crew before the next release.
- **Rollback:** nothing to roll back (the file is removed).

If a release fails with `memory guard: N MB available, below DEPLOY_MIN_AVAILABLE_MB`, nothing
changed on the box. Find what is using memory (`docker stats --no-stream`), and either free it or,
once swap is on and you accept the risk, lower `DEPLOY_MIN_AVAILABLE_MB` in `.deploy.env`, then
dispatch the release again.

## 4. `mem_limit` lines in the prod compose

A limit turns "the whole box goes into the OOM killer" into "one container is restarted". Sizes
come from the 10 Sep measurements in `PLAN-deploy-memory-and-ci-speed.md` (one colour: backend
4.7 GB before gunicorn preload, preload target under 3 GB; db 2.0 GB; frontend 0.67 GB; redis
0.53 GB; worker + worker_fast 0.3 GB) plus headroom. **Re-check against your step 3 numbers:**
every limit must be at least 1.5 times what that container uses today. If the backend colour
still uses more than 2.3 GB, use `5g` for both backend colours instead of `3500m`.

| Service | `mem_limit` | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `db` | `4g` | 2.0 GB measured; the pre-migration `pg_dump` runs inside this container too |
| `backend_blue`, `backend_green` | `3500m` | preload target under 3 GB; a worker over the limit is killed and gunicorn respawns it |
| `frontend_blue`, `frontend_green` | `1g` | 0.67 GB measured |
| `worker` | `2g` | imports and catalogue PDF renders (Chromium) spike above the idle 0.3 GB |
| `worker_fast` | `1g` | same image, lighter queues |

The limits are ceilings, not reservations: during the blue/green overlap their sum can exceed
16 GB. The memory guard (step 3) and swap (step 2) cover that window.

Edit `<PROD_COMPOSE>` (keep a copy first) and add one line per service, at the same indent as
`image:`:

```bash
cd /opt/sorento-crm2
cp docker-compose.yml "docker-compose.yml.bak-$(date +%Y%m%d)"
```

```yaml
services:
  db:
    mem_limit: 4g
  backend_blue:
    mem_limit: 3500m
  backend_green:
    mem_limit: 3500m
  frontend_blue:
    mem_limit: 1g
  frontend_green:
    mem_limit: 1g
  worker:
    mem_limit: 2g
  worker_fast:
    mem_limit: 1g
```

```bash
docker compose config --quiet && echo compose-ok
```

Apply without restarting anything: the backend colours, frontends and workers pick the limit up
when the next release recreates them. For the running `db`, set the same limit live (no restart;
`--memory-swap` is twice the limit, which is what compose gives a `mem_limit` by default):

```bash
docker update --memory 4g --memory-swap 8g "$(docker compose ps -q db)"
```

- **Check:** `compose-ok` printed; `docker inspect --format '{{.HostConfig.Memory}}' "$(docker compose ps -q db)"`
  prints `4294967296`; after the next release, `docker stats --no-stream` shows a `LIMIT` column
  matching the table for every listed container.
- **Rollback:** `cp docker-compose.yml.bak-<date> docker-compose.yml`, and for the db:
  `docker update --memory 0 --memory-swap -1 "$(docker compose ps -q db)"` (0 = no limit).
  Mirror the same edit into the local gitignored copy (`sorento_crm/docker-compose.yml` on your
  machine) so the two do not drift.

## 5. `SKIP_MIGRATIONS` pass-through (for rollbacks across a migration)

The rollback workflow runs the deploy script with `SKIP_MIGRATIONS=1`, because an older image's
`alembic upgrade head` does not know a newer revision and would fail. The variable only reaches
the container when the compose passes it through. In `<PROD_COMPOSE>`, under **both**
`backend_blue` and `backend_green`, in the `environment:` list (create it if missing):

```yaml
    environment:
      SKIP_MIGRATIONS: ${SKIP_MIGRATIONS:-0}
```

A normal release does not set it, so migrations still run. Note: this line wins over any
`SKIP_MIGRATIONS` in the backend `.env`; for a manual expand-contract rollout, set it in the
shell instead (`SKIP_MIGRATIONS=1 docker compose ...`).

- **Check:** `docker compose config | grep -n SKIP_MIGRATIONS` shows `SKIP_MIGRATIONS: "0"` under
  both colours.
- **Rollback:** delete the two lines. A rollback across a migration then fails its health check and
  the current colour keeps serving (safe, just not useful).

## 6. A monitor on `/health/deep`

The outside uptime monitor itself (Uptime Kuma polling `/api/v1/health`, which checks the
database only) is set up in `monitoring.md`. This step adds the deeper check, Redis and the
scheduler, on top of it.

`/health` stays the blue/green readiness probe and still answers 200 when only the database is up.
Its body now also carries `"redis": "ok"|"down"|"timeout"|"error"` and
`"scheduler": {"status": "ok"|"overdue"|..., "overdue_count": N, "last_task_run_at": ...}`.
`/health/deep` answers 503 unless the database, Redis and the scheduler are all OK. "Overdue"
uses the same rule as the admin health dashboard: an enabled scheduled task late past its grace.

On the box, against the live colour (`cat .active_color`: blue is 8000, green is 8010):

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://127.0.0.1:8000/health/deep
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/health/deep
```

- **Check:** `200` and `"status":"healthy"`. A `503` names the failing part.
- For an outside monitor, expose it to the monitor only, rate-limited. The route has no login,
  and its body says how many scheduled tasks are late. In the host nginx `http` block (once):

  ```nginx
  limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=health_deep:1m rate=6r/m;
  ```

  and in the server block that proxies `/api/v1` on the API host:

  ```nginx
  location = /health/deep {
      allow <MONITOR_IP>;
      deny all;
      limit_req zone=health_deep burst=3 nodelay;
      proxy_pass http://sorento_backend;
  }
  ```

  Behind Cloudflare, `allow` only works on the real client address: do this after
  `prod-edge-lockdown.md` step 5 (nginx real client IP). Then `sudo nginx -t && sudo nginx -s reload`,
  and point the monitor at `https://<CRM_DOMAIN>/health/deep`, alerting on anything but 200.
- **Check:** from the monitor's address the URL answers 200; from anywhere else, 403.
- **Rollback:** remove the `location` block and the `limit_req_zone` line,
  `sudo nginx -t && sudo nginx -s reload`.

## 7. Rollback a bad release

Code only: the database stays at its current schema (see step 8 for data).

1. Find the last good release: GitHub, Actions, "Deploy", filter `event: workflow_dispatch`, branch
   `main`, a green run before the bad one. Copy its full commit SHA (`<RELEASED_SHA>`).
2. Actions, "Rollback production", "Run workflow", branch `main`, paste `<RELEASED_SHA>`, Run.
3. Approve it under "Review deployments" (the same `production` gate as a release). It queues
   behind any running release.

The workflow refuses a SHA that is not 40 hex characters, not on main, has no successful release
run, or whose images are gone from the registry. It then runs today's `blue_green_deploy.sh` (all
guards above, snapshot included) with `IMAGE_TAG=<RELEASED_SHA>` and `SKIP_MIGRATIONS=1`.

- **Check:** the run is green, and on the box
  `docker inspect --format '{{.Config.Image}}' "$(docker compose ps -q backend_$(cat .active_color))"`
  ends in `<RELEASED_SHA>`.
- If the run is red only at "Promote the rollback images to the release tag" (a registry blip after
  the server step succeeded), the box already runs `<RELEASED_SHA>`: use "Re-run failed jobs" so
  the moving release tag follows. Until then a manual `docker compose up` with no `IMAGE_TAG`
  would pull the bad release.
- **Rollback:** dispatch "Rollback production" again with the newer SHA, or dispatch a release
  from main.

## 8. Restore from a pre-migration snapshot (emergency only)

Every release writes `/opt/sorento-crm2/backups/pre-migrate/pre-migrate-<UTC time>-<sha>.dump`
(owner-only permissions) before the new colour migrates, and deletes ones older than 48 h.
**Restoring loses every write since the snapshot.** Use it only when a migration damaged data and
a code rollback cannot fix it. Rehearse into a scratch database first:

```bash
cd /opt/sorento-crm2
ls -lt backups/pre-migrate/ | head
F=backups/pre-migrate/<file>.dump
docker compose exec -T db sh -c 'createdb -U "$POSTGRES_USER" restore_check'
docker compose exec -T db sh -c 'pg_restore -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d restore_check --no-owner; cat > /dev/null' < "$F"
docker compose exec -T db sh -c 'psql -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d restore_check -Atc "select version_num from alembic_version"'
```

- **Check:** the last command prints the alembic revision from before the release.
- **Rollback (of the rehearsal):** `docker compose exec -T db sh -c 'dropdb -U "$POSTGRES_USER" restore_check'`.

The real restore (stop writers first: both backend colours, `worker`, `worker_fast`; then
`pg_restore --clean --if-exists -d <APP_DB>` from the same file, `<APP_DB>` being the database
the snapshot was taken of (the deploy log's `snapshot: ... of <APP_DB>` line); then roll the code back with
step 7) is a decision to take with crew, not from this page alone.

If a release fails with `pre-migration snapshot failed`, nothing migrated. Check disk
(`df -h /opt/sorento-crm2`) and the db logs (`docker compose logs --tail=50 db`), then dispatch
the release again.

## 9. A migration failed on `lock timeout`

**This is a behaviour change.** During a release the OLD colour keeps running while the new
colour migrates: its backend, and both workers (they are recreated only after the nginx swap).
Before this lane, a migration that needed a lock one of their transactions held simply queued
behind it, and every other query on that table queued behind the migration: a silent stall for
as long as the old transaction ran. Now the migration gives up after 5s: the new colour never goes
healthy, the release fails, and the old colour keeps serving. Nothing half-migrated is left: the
migration's transaction rolls back (a migration with an `autocommit_block` commits its earlier
part, and such migrations are written to be rerun).

The deploy log shows `not healthy`, and the backend log printed above it has
`canceling statement due to lock timeout`.

**Retry** (usually enough): find what held the table, let it finish, dispatch the release again.

```bash
cd /opt/sorento-crm2
docker compose exec -T -e DUMP_DB=<APP_DB> db sh -c 'psql -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$DUMP_DB" -c "select pid, state, now() - xact_start as open_for, left(query, 60) as query from pg_stat_activity where xact_start is not null and pid <> pg_backend_pid() order by xact_start limit 10"'
```

- **Check:** the oldest rows are an import or report on the worker that is still running. Wait for
  it (the import screens show progress), run the query again until nothing is older than a few
  seconds, then dispatch the release.
- **Rollback:** nothing to roll back; the old colour is still serving.

**Override for one migration** (when the table is always busy): the migration raises its own
limit, and `alembic/env.py` puts the default back after it, so the next migration is unaffected.

```python
def upgrade():
    op.execute("SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '60s'")   # this migration's transaction only
    ...
    # before an op.get_context().autocommit_block(), use a session-level SET instead:
    # op.execute("SET lock_timeout = '60s'")
```

That is a code change (a PR). For one release without a code change, set it in the backend env
the new colour starts with, then take it out again:

```bash
# in the env file backend_blue / backend_green read (their env_file in the prod compose)
MIGRATION_LOCK_TIMEOUT=60s
```

- **Check:** the release goes green, and
  `docker compose logs backend_$(cat .active_color) | grep -c 'lock timeout'` prints 0.
- **Rollback:** delete the `MIGRATION_LOCK_TIMEOUT` line (the 5s default applies from the next
  release). Do not leave a long value there: it brings the silent stall back.

## When a release fails on a guard

| Message in the "Deploy to Server" log | Meaning | Do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `... is still held (another deploy or the restore test)` | another release or the restore test ran for 10 min | wait for it, dispatch again |
| `cannot tell which database the app uses` | no `DEPLOY_DB_NAME` and no usable `DATABASE_URL` on the active backend | step 3, `db name` |
| `does not list TABLE DATA public alembic_version` | the dump is of the wrong database, or broken | step 3, `alembic_version` |
| `cannot open the deploy lock` | the deploy user cannot create the lock file | step 0 |
| `must be a whole number` | a typo in `.deploy.env` | step 3 (run `--preflight`) |
| `snapshot disk check` | not enough free disk for the dump | free disk (`docker image prune`, old files), or step 3 |
| `Postgres container 'db' not found` | service name differs | step 3 |
| `pre-migration snapshot failed` | dump could not be written or checked | step 8, last paragraph |
| `memory guard: N MB available` | not enough RAM for a second colour | step 3, last paragraph |
| `Postgres ... restarted` / `crash-recovered` before the swap | Postgres went down while the new colour started | old colour still serves; `docker compose logs --tail=200 db`, `dmesg -T \| grep -i oom`, then dispatch again |
| `deploy FAILED: Postgres went down during the deploy` | same, after the swap | the new colour serves; check the app, then the same logs |
| `canceling statement due to lock timeout` in the backend log | a migration waited more than 5s for a table the old colour held | step 9 |
| `canceling statement due to statement timeout` | a migration statement ran more than 180s | the migration must raise its own limit (see `app/utils/migration_timeouts.py`), or set `MIGRATION_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT` in the backend `.env` for one release |
