# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the corresponding label string from this table.

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use.

## Repo state

All five labels exist on `jayson-odoo/sorento-crm`. `wontfix` is GitHub's stock
label and was reused as-is; the other four were created during setup.

The stock labels `bug`, `documentation`, `enhancement`, `duplicate`,
`good first issue`, `help wanted`, `invalid` and `question` also exist. They are
orthogonal to triage state — an issue can carry both `bug` and `needs-triage`.
The five above are the ones the state machine owns; leave the rest to humans.
